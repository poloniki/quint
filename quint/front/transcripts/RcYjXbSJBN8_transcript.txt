welcome back. here we go again. great to see you and congratulations. thank you, um, you will never forget what is going on in the world. when you think about when your child is born, you will know for the rest of this child's life you were born during a weird time, that's for sure. that is for sure. they're probably the weirdest that i can remember. uh, yeah, yeah, um, and he was born on uh, may the fourth, and yeah, that's hilarious too. yeah, may the fourth be with him. yeah, exactly, it has to be, hopefully- i sure hope so- perfect. yes, i mean, that was the perfect day for you. and how do you say the name? well, uh, is it a placeholder? first of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name. congratulations to her, yeah, yeah, she's great at names. um, so i mean it's just x, the letter x, um, and then the ae is like pronounced ash, yeah, and then a12. a12 is my contribution. oh, why a12? uh, archangel 12, the precursor to the sr-71- coolest plane ever, that's true, i, i agree with you. i don't know. i'm not familiar with it. i know what the sr-71 is, yeah, yeah, yeah, i know what that is. so the sr71 came from a cia program uh called archangel. oh, it's the archangel project and then archangel 12.. oh, wow, what a dope-looking plane. yeah, oh, okay, i got it. yeah, well, as a person who's uh very much into, uh, aerial travel, as you are, that's uh perfect. that's pretty great. yeah, pretty great. um, so, is it? does it feel strange to have a child while this craziness is going? does it feel like you've had children before? is this any weirder? uh, it's actually. i think it's better. uh, being older and having a kid, i appreciate it more. um, yeah, babies are awesome. they are pretty awesome. they're awesome. yeah, when i didn't have my any of my own, i would see other people's kids and i didn't not like them, sure, but i wasn't drawn to them, sure, but now, when i see little people's kids, i'm like, oh, i think of them, like these little love packages, yeah, little love bugs. yeah, it's just you. you think of them differently when you see them come out and then grow and then eventually start talking to you, like your whole idea what a baby is is very different. yeah, so now, as you, you know, get older and get to appreciate it as a mature, fully formed adult. it must be really pretty wonderful, yeah, wonderful, it's great. but babies are awesome. yeah, yeah, that's uh, that's great. um, yeah, um, i mean, also, i've i've spent a lot of time on ai and neural nets, and so you can sort of see the kind of the brain develop which is, you know what an ai neural net is, trying to simulate what a brain does, basically, um, and you can sort of see the it learning very quickly. you know, it's just wow, see things fire. so you're talking about the neural net. you're not talking about an actual baby. i don't know about actually an actual baby, but both of them. yes, but the word neural net comes from the, the brain. it's like a net of neurons. so, you know, it's like the. yeah, humans are the- you know, original gangster, the neural net, that's a great way to put it. yeah, so when you're programming artificial intelligence, where you're working with artificial intelligence art, are they specifically trying to mimic the developmental process of a human brain? in a lot of ways- there's some ways that are different. um, you know, an analogy that's often used is: like, you know, we, we don't make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of, of how, you know what, of hydrodynamics and apply them to a submarine. i've always wondered, as a lay person: do you try to achieve the same results as a human brain but through different methods, or do you try to copy the way a human brain achieves results? i mean, the essential elements of an ai neural net are really very, very similar to a human brain neural net. yeah, it's having the multiple layers of neurons and, you know, back propagation, these all these things are what your brain does. you know. it's sort of, yeah, um, you have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and that, and then it'll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place. um, it's, um, yeah, it's. it's interesting, very interesting. yeah, i would imagine, like the thought of programming something that is eventually going to be smarter than us, that one day it's going to be like: why did you do it that way? like when artificial intelligence becomes sentient, they're like: oh, you tried to mimic yourself like this so much better process, cut out all this nonsense. but like there are elements that are the same, but just almost. like like an aircraft does not fly like a bird, right, yeah, it doesn't flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift, is the same as bird. now you're in the middle of this, uh, this strange time where you're selling your houses, you say you don't want any material possessions, and i've been seeing all that and i've been really excited to talk to you about this. yeah, because it's an interesting thing to come from a guy like yourself, like, why are you doing that? i'm slightly sad about it actually. but if you're sad about it, why are you doing it? i think i think possessions kind of weigh you down. then they're kind of an attack vector. you know people say, hey, billionaire, you got all this stuff like well, and now i don't have stuff. now, what are you gonna do? attack vector, meaning like people target it, yeah, um, interesting, yeah, but you're obviously gonna. so you're gonna rent a place, yeah, okay, and get rid of everything except clothes. no, i said like almost everything. so it's like: keep a couple teslas, yeah, sure, yeah, kind of have to test product and stuff. um, yeah, those things that have sentimental value for sure are keeping those here? um, yeah, so do you feel like what's worse? that could happen? right, you're fine. yeah, you could always buy more stuff if you don't like it especially. yeah, i mean, from the money that you sell all your stuff you could buy new stuff. but do you you feel like people define you by the fact that you're you're wealthy, and that they define you in a pejorative way? for sure, i mean not everyone, but right, you know there's, uh, for sure in recent like years, billionaire has become a per jar, like it's in a projective, so like it's like that's a bad thing, um, which i mean i think doesn't make a lot of sense in most cases. if you've, if you're done, if you basically uh organized a company like see, like how do, how does this wealth arise? it's if you organize people in a in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company, then that that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital. so it's there's a conflation of consumption and capital allocation. so let me say warren buffett, for example- and to get totally frank, i'm not his biggest fan, but uh, you know he does a lot of capital allocation, um, and he reads a lot of, a lot of sort of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it's pretty boring really. um, and he's trying to figure out is: does coke or pepsi deserve more capital? i mean that's. i mean it's kind of a boring job. if you ask me, um, but uh, you know, it's still a thing that's important to figure out, like which is a company deserving of more or less capital? should that company grow or expand? is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? and you know, should you know, if a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital, and if it's not, it should get less. we'll go out of business. well, there's a big difference, too, between someone who's making an incredible amount of money designing and engineering fantastic products versus someone who's making an incredible amount of money by investing in companies or moving money around in the stock market or doing things along those lines. it's, it's a different thing, and to put them all in the same category seems it's. it's very simple and, as you pointed out, it's an attack vector. yeah, for sure. yeah, i mean, i think it's, it's really. i, i do think they're in the. in the united states especially, there's an over allocation of talent, uh, in finance and law. uh, basically, too many smart people go into finance and law. so, you know, this is both a compliment and a criticism we should have of, i think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff. yeah, yeah, well, that would certainly be better for all involved if they made better stuff. yeah, yeah, absolutely, um, and, and you know, manufacturing used to be highly valued in the united states and these days it's not. it's it's often looked down upon, which i think is wrong. yeah, well, i think that people are kind of learning that, particularly because of this whole pandemic and this relationship that we have with china, that it there's a lot of value into making things, into making things here. yes, somebody's got to do the, the real work. yeah, you know. and, um, you know, like, making a car, it's an honest days. that's not honest day is living, that's for sure, you know. or making anything really, or providing valuable service. um, like providing, you know, greater entertainment, good information, but these are all valuable things to do, um, you know. so, yeah, there should be more, more of it. did you have a moment where is this something? that this idea of getting rid of your material possessions is something that built up over time? or did you have a moment of realization where you realize that, yeah, i've been thinking about it for a while? um, you know, part of it is like i like have a bunch of houses, but i don't spend a lot of time in most of them and that doesn't seem like a good use of assets, like somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them than me. so don't you have gene wilder's house? i do. that's amazing. that's awesome. wow, exactly what you'd expect. did you request that the buyer not [ __ ] it up? yeah, that's a requirement. oh, a requirement, that's. that's a good requirement. yeah, not in that case in that house. yeah, it'll probably sell for last, but still, i don't care. uh, he's a legend. yeah, he would want his soul, he'd want his essence. yeah, in the building it's and it's there. that's a real quirky, quirky house. yeah, what? what makes you say it's there? like, what do you get out of it? um, i mean, all the, all the cabinets are like handmade and they're like odd shapes and there's like doors to nowhere and strange, like car doors and tunnels and really odd, odd paintings on the wall. and um, yeah, did you ever live in it? it's very quirky. i did live in it briefly, yeah, but why do you buy houses? like, if you own all these houses, do you just get bored and go? i think i'd like to have that. well, i, you know, had one house and then the junior wilder house right across the road from me, from from my main house, and it was going to get, it was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years and i was like, well, i think i'll, i'll buy it and preserve the spurt of gene water and not have a giant construction zone. and then the you know this, i started having like some privacy issues where, like people would like less people just like come to my house and, you know, start climbing over the walls and stuff. i feel like man, um. so then i saw like what a house, some of the houses around my house, and then i thought at one point, well, you know, it'd be cool to to build a house. so then i acquired some properties at the top of samara road, uh, and which is got a great view, and it's like, okay, well, these some bunch of sort of small older houses, they're going to get torn down. anyway. i was like, well, you know, if i collect these like little little houses, then i can build something. you know, i don't know, artistic, like a you know dream house type of thing. what's a dream house for elon musk? like some tony stark type? [ __ ]. yeah, definitely, yeah, you gotta have the, the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing. you know, yeah for sure. [ __ ]. yeah, yeah, um. but but then i was like man, do i really want, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house? and i'd be real, you know, get out like ocd on the little details and the design- and or should i be allocating that time to getting us to mars? i should probably do the latter. so you know, like, what's more important, mars or a house? i like mars, okay, is that really how you think? like that it'd be better off planning on a trip to mars or getting people to mars. yeah, yeah, definitely. i mean, you can only do so many things, right, right. so how you can? i don't know how you do what you do. anyway, i don't. i don't understand how you can run bull with a boring company- tesla, spacex, all these different things you're doing constantly- i just i don't understand. i mean, you explained last time you were here how you sort of allocate your time and and how hectic it is and insane. i still don't the the productivity is, uh, baffling. just doesn't make sense how you can get so much done. well, i think i do have high productivity, but even with that, there's still some upgraded cost of time. and allocating time to building a house- even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to mars and helping sell sustainable energy. uh, spacex and tesla are by far, you know, by the- the most amount of like brain cycles. um, you know, boring company does not take, you know, like less than one percent of brain cycles and um, and then this neural link which is, i don't know, maybe it's like five percent, and then five percent, that's, that's a good chunk. it's a good chunk, yeah. yeah, we were talking about that last time and you were trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live, when it's actually going to be available. are you testing on people right now? no, we're not testing people yet, but i i think it won't be too long. i think we may be able to implant a neurolink in less than a year in a person, i think. and when you do this, is there any tests that you have to do before you do something like this to to see what percentage of people's bodies are going to reject these things? is it put? is it there? is there a potential for rejection? it's a very low potential for rejection. i mean, you can think of it like people put in, you know, heart monitors and, um, you know things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation. um, obviously, like you know, artificial hips and right knees and that kind of thing. so the probability of, i mean, like it's so it's well known, like what will cause rejection? what, what will not? um, it's definitely harder when you've got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons. that's that's generating a current pulse and reading current pulses, that's that's a little harder. um, then then say, uh, passive device, but it's still, you know, very doable and um, yeah, there, there are people who have primitive devices in in their brains right now. what kind of devices i like deep brain stimulation is, i think, for parkinson's is like, has really changed people's lives in a big way, um, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain. um, it's like kicking the tv type of thing, um, and you think, like man kicking the tv shouldn't work. it does sometimes. yeah, yeah, the old old tvs, it did. my grandpa used to slap the top for sure. yeah, it would work sometimes. yeah, so this deep right simulation, uh, implanted devices in the brain that uh have changed people's lives for the better, like fundamentally. well, let's talk about what you can talk about, to what neurolink is, because the last time you were here you really couldn't discuss it and then there was a, i guess a press release or something that sort of outlined. yeah, that that happened quite a bit after the last time you were here. so what exactly is it? how do you do what? what happens if someone ultimately does get a neurolink installed? what will take place? well, for version one of the device, it would be it basically implanted in your skull, so, but it would be flush with your skull. so you basically uh, take out a chunk of skull, replace, put the neurologic device in there, um, you put the, the electrode. you'd insert the electrode threads very carefully into the, the brain and uh, and then you, you know, stitch it up and um, and you wouldn't even know that somebody has it and then and, and so then it, it can interface basically anywhere in any, anywhere in your brain. um, so it could be something that, uh, you know, helps cure, say, uh, eyesight, like give you returns your eyesight even if you've like lost your optic nerve type of thing. uh, really, yeah, yeah, absolutely hearing, obviously, um, i mean pretty much anything that where that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain and it could restore uh limb functionality. so if you've got uh interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that's say that's like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, uh, you, you could then create a sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who's a quadriplegic to full functionality, like they can walk around, be normal. whoa, yeah, so maybe slightly better, slightly better over time. yes, you mean with future iterations like the, you know, six million dollar, man, although these days that would, that doesn't matter. yeah, six billion dollars. so the the hole would be small. how big would the hole be that you have to drill and then replace with this piece. it's only one hole. well, um, yeah, the device we're working on right now is about it's about an inch in diameter, um, and your skull is pretty thick, by the way. so skulls are- mine is for sure. it might actually literally, um, i mean, if you're a big, if you're a big guy, your skull is actually fairly thick. um, skulls like it's like seven to 14 millimeters, um, so that's probably a couple inches, a half inch, you know, half inch thick skull, ish. so, um, yeah, yeah, so that's a fair bit of like our, we got quite a coconut going on here. it's not, it's not like some egg shell. oh, yeah, i believe you, um, so the yeah, you basically implant the device, uh, and so you would be like a one inch square, one inch in diameter, yeah, like so an inch circle, like a circular, yeah, i think, like a, like a smart watch or something like that. okay, yeah, okay. so you take this one-inch diameter like ice fishing, right, you ever go ice fishing? um, no, but i'd like to. it's great, yeah, it's really fun. so you basically take an auger and you, you drill through the surface of the ice, yeah, and you create a small hole and you can dunk your line in there. so this is like that you're ice fishing on the top of your skull and then you cork it, yeah, and you replace that, say, one inch diameter piece of skull with this neural link device and that has a battery and a and a bluetooth and a inductive charger. um, and then you and, and now then you also got to insert the electrodes. uh, so the electrode is very carefully inserted, uh, with our, with a robot that we developed, uh, that's, you know, very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding, you know, and any veins or arteries. uh, so it's, you know, doesn't create trauma. so, through this one-inch diameter device, electrodes be inserted and they will find their way, like tiny wires, basically tiny wires, and they'll find their way to specific areas of the brain to stimulate. no, you literally put them where they're supposed to go. oh, okay, yeah, how long will these wires be? uh, i mean, they usually go in, like, you know, depending on where it is, like, you know, two or three millimeters, so they just find the spots. yeah, wow, um, and then, um, yeah, then you put the device in and that that gets, uh, that that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out. uh, and then you, you stitch up the hole and and um, and you just have it look like a little scar and that's it. well, this would be replaceable or reversible. yes, like if someone can't take it anymore- i'm too smart, i can't take it- yeah, you can totally check it out. and what is the besides restoring limb function and eyesight and hearing, which are all amazing- is there, are there any cognitive benefits that you anticipate from something like this? uh, yeah, i mean you could, for sure, um, uh, i mean basically, it's a generalized, um sort of uh thing for for fixing any kind of brain injury in, in principle, like if you, or if you've got like like severe epilepsy or something like that, it could, it could just, it could just sort of stop the epilepsy from occurring, like it could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy. um, if, um, i mean there's a whole range of brain injuries, like if somebody gets a stroke, they could lose the ability to speak. um, you know that that'll stack could also be fixed. so if you've got like stroke damage or if you lose, say, you know, muscle control over part of your face or something like that i think, and then when, when you get old, you tend to, if you get like, you know, alzheimer's or something like that, then you lose memory and this could help you with, you know, restoring your memory, that kind of thing, restoring memory and what. what is happening that's allowing it to do that, like the wires, these small wires stimulating these areas of the brain, and then is it that the areas of the brain are they're they're losing some sort of electrical force, like what it? what is happening? yeah, yeah, it's, it's like. it's like, i think it's like a bunch of circuits and there's some like circuits that are broken and we can like, uh, fix those circuits, substitute for those circuit circuits, and so a specific frequency will go through this. yeah, specific in that would is the process figuring out how much or how little has to be, how, how much these areas of the brain have to be juiced up. yeah, i mean, there's still a lot of work to do. so when i say, you know, we got a shot at probably putting it in in a person, in you know a, within a year, i think that's, that's what. that's exactly what i mean. i think we have a chance of putting input into one and having them, having them be healthy and and restoring some functionality that they've lost. the fear is that eventually you're gonna have to cut the whole top of someone's head off and put a new top with a whole bunch of wires if you want to get, you know, the real turbocharged version, the p100d of brain stimulation. i mean, ultimately, if you, if you want to go with full ai symbiosis, you'll probably want to do something like that. symbiosis is a scary word when it comes to ai, it's optional [Laughter]. i would hope so. yeah, it's just. i mean, once you enjoy the dr manhattan lifestyle, once you, once you become a god seems very, very unlikely- you're going to want to go back to being stupid again. i mean you, you literally could fundamentally change the way human beings interface with each other. yes, yes, you wouldn't need to talk. i'm so scared of that but so excited about it at the same time. is that weird? yeah, i mean the. i think this is one of the paths to um. you know, i think like, what? like ai is getting better and better um. so now let's assume it's sort of like a benign ai scenario. even in a benign scenario, we're kind of left behind. you know, we're we're not, we're not along for the ride? um, we're just too dumb, right, so so how do you go along for the ride? um, yeah, so you can't beat them, join them. so, um, and we're already, we're already a cyborg to some degree, right, because you've got your phone, you've got your laptop, glasses, yeah, yeah, guitar, electronic devices, and i mean today, if you your phone, if you, if you don't bring your phone along, it's like you have missing limb syndrome. that's like you know, it feels like something's really, really missing. so we're already partly um, part, you know, partly a cyborg, um, or an ai symbiote, essentially um. it's just that the data rate to the electronics is slow, so, especially output, like you're just going with your thumbs, i don't know like what's your data rate, maybe, optimistically, 100 bits per second. that's being generous, um, and now the computer can communicate at, like you know, 100 terabits, you know so. so certainly you know, gigabits are a trivial at this point. so this, this is, like you know, basically your computer could do a mil, do things a million times faster, or, at a certain point, it's like talk they as like talking to a tree. okay, it's boring, you talk to a tree. it's very, not very entertaining. um, so, um, so if you, if you can solve the- the data rate issue and your especially output, but input two, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between mana machine. so you, you can improve it. in what? when you said you won't have to talk to each other anymore, we used to joke around about that. i- i've joked around about that a million times in this podcast- that one day in the future there's going to come a time where you can read each other's minds, and well, you'll be able to interface with each other in some sort of a non-verbal, non-physical way where you will transfer data back and forth to each other without having to actually use your mouth and make noises. exactly so, when you like. what happens when you when, like, let's say, you've got some complex idea that you're trying to convey to somebody else, and how do you do that? well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there's a, there's a lot, a lot of loss, information loss- that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words, and then you say those words. those words are then interpreted, then they're decompressed by the person who is listening and they, they will at best get a very incomplete understanding of what you're trying to convey. it's very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you've got compression, decompression. you may not even have heard all the words correctly, and so communication is difficult. you know, what we have here is a failure to communicate. cool and luke- yes, and there's a great movie. yeah, there's an interpretation factor too. like you can choose to interpret certain series of words in in different ways and they're dependent upon tone, dependent upon social cues, even facial expressions, sarcasm- there's a lot of variables. sarcasm is difficult, yes, yeah, and so one of the things that i i've said is like that there could be potentially a universal language that's created through computers that particularly young kids would pick up very quickly. like my kids do tick, tock and all this jazz, and i don't know what they're doing. they just know how to do it, and they know how to do it really quickly. like they learn really quickly, they show me how to edit things and, yeah, it's. if you taught a child from first grade on how to use some new universal language, i mean essentially like a rosetta stone and something that's done that interprets your thoughts and you can convey your thoughts with no room for interpretation with clear, very clear that where you know what a person's saying and you can tell them what you're saying and there's no need for noises, no need for mouth noises, no need for these sort of accepted ways that we've uh sort of evolved to make sounds that we all agree. we, through our cultural dictionary, right, we agree, or certainly we could bypass all that. yeah, we can still do it for for sentimental reasons, right, like campfires, yeah, yeah, exactly, i don't need campfires, i don't need to roast marshmallows, kind of fun, right, um, so, yeah, um, yeah, i think you would. in principle, you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision, ideas and language would. i'm not sure what would happen to language, but you could probably, within a situation like this that you would be able to just kind of like the matrix, you, you want to speak a different language in a problem, right, that's why it just downloaded the program, right, so at least for the first iterations, first few iterations, we'll just be able to use, like i, i know that google has, uh, their, some of their pixel buds have the ability to interpret languages in real time. sure, yeah, you can hear it and they'll, it'll play things back to you in whatever language you choose, so to be something along those lines: yeah, for the first few iterations. well, the first few iterations are. i mean, what i'm talking about is like in the limit over time, you know, with a lot of development, um, the first few iterations, really, in the first few versions, all we're going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries, um, so so it's like, don't, don't worry that that's not going to sneak up on you. this, this will take a while. how many years before you don't have to talk? if the, if the development continues to accelerate, then maybe like five years, five to ten years, that's quick, that's really quick. that's the best case scenario, no talking anymore in five years, best case scenario. but i'm 10, 10 years, more like it. i've always speculated that aliens could potentially be us in the future, because if you look at like the size their heads and the fact that they have very little muscle and then they don't use their mouth anymore, they was tiny, little. i mean, the archetypal alien that you see in like closing counters are the third kind they they're like. if you went from like uh, australopithecus or ancient hominid to us, what's the difference? less hair, less muscle, bigger head, and then just keep going a thousand, a million, whatever you, or five years, whatever, whatever happens when neurolink goes on online and then we slowly start to adapt to this new way of being where we don't use our muscles anymore. we have this gigantic head, we can talk without words. you could also save state and save state. save state like save your brain. state like like a saved game in a video game, whoa. like like, if you want to swap from windows 95, well, yeah, i think we are windows 95 right now. yeah, from a future perspective, probably, um, but yeah, i mean you. you could save state, um and restore that state into a biological being if you, if you wanted to in the future. in principle, it's like nothing, like from a physics standpoint, that prevents us. now you'd be a little different, but then you're also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday and you're a little different. in fact, if you say, like you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference. yes, um, so you'd be substantially you. i mean you'd be. you'd certainly think you're you, but the idea of saving yourself and then transforming that into some sort of a biological state like you can hang out with 30 year old you. i mean, the possibilities are endless. that's so weird. i mean these things. think like how your phone can? you can record videos on your phone, like there's no way you could remember a video right as accurately as your phone or a camera you know could. so, uh, now if you've got like a you know some, some, you know version 10 hero, link, whatever, and far in the future, you could, you could remember, you could recall everything, but just like it's a movie concluding all the entire sensory experience, emotions, everything, everything, everything- and play it back and you can enjoy it. you should edit it. edit it, yeah, so you can change your past. you could change what do you think was your past? yeah, well, so if you had like a tremendous thing right now could be a replayed memory, it could be. yeah, it may be. what's the odds of this being a replayed memory? if you had a guess, it's more than 50. there's no way to assign a probability with accuracy here. right, but roughly. if you just had a just gut instinct. well, i don't have a neural link in my brain, so i say right now, zero percent. but at the point at which you do have a neural link, then it rises above zero percent. the idea that we're experiencing some sort of a preserved memory is, uh, even though it's still the same, it's not comforting, right, for some reason. when we people talk about simulation theory, they talk about the potential for this currently being a simulation. it, even though your life might be wonderful, you might be in love, you might love your career, you might have great friends, but it's not comforting to know that this experience, somehow or another, doesn't exist in a material form that you can knock on. it feels real, doesn't? it feels real, but but if it's not? but the idea that it's not is, for some strange reason, disconcerting. well, yeah, i'm sure it should be disconcerting, because then, if this is not real, what is right? um, but but the? you know, there's that, that old sort of um thought experiment of like: how do you know you're not a brain in a vet? you know? i mean, now, here's the thing: you are a brain, an event. then that fat is your skull, yes, and everything you see, feel here, everything, all your senses, are electrical signals. everything, everything is an electrical signal to up to a brain in a vat, where the vat is called, and all your hormones, all your neurotransmitters, all these things are drugs. adrenaline's a drug, dopamine's a drug. you're a drug factory. you're constantly changing your state with love and oxytocin and, and beauty sure changes your state. great music changes your state absolutely. and yet here's another sort of interesting idea, which is: um, because you say, like, where did consciousness arise? well, assuming you believe the belief in physics, which appears to be true, um, then you know, we, the universe, started off as basically quarks and leptons, and it quickly became hydrogen and of helium, lithium, like basically elements, the periodic table, but it was like mostly hydrogen, basically. and then, and then, over a long period of time, uh, you know, 13.8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient. but so where, along the way that conju, where is the consciousness? what's the line of consciousness and not consciousness right between hydrogen and here, right, when do we call it? when do we call it consciousness? i was watching a video today that we played on a podcast earlier of a monkey riding a motorcycle down the street, jumps off the motorcycle and tries to steal a baby. yeah, i saw that one. they went apparel. what is that monkey? conscious? it seems like it is. it seems like it had a plan. it was riding a [ __ ] motorcycle and then jumped off the motorcycle to try to steal a baby. seems pretty, the one that just strike baby down the street pretty far. yeah, yeah, seems pretty conscious, right, there's definitely some degree of consciousness there. yeah, it's not like it's not a worm, it seems to be on another level. yeah, and it's going to keep going, and that that's the real concern. when, when people think about the potential future versions of human beings, especially when you consider symbiotic relationship to artificial intelligence, it will be unrecognizable that one day we'll be so far removed from what this is. we'll look back on this the way we look back now on, you know, simple, simple organisms that we evolved from, and then it won't be that far in the future that we do have this, this view back. well, i hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more, more sophisticated and complex, and and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe. do you think that's the case? as a human being, as yourself, you're clearly trying to make conscious decisions, to be a better version of you, right? this is the idea of like, getting rid of your possessions and realizing that you're trying to like. i don't like this. i will try to improve this. i will try to do a better version of the way i interface with reality. that this is always the way things are. if you're, if you're moving in a some sort of a direction where you're trying to improve things, you're always going to move into this new place where you look back in the old place and go: i was doing it wrong back then. so this is an accelerated version of that, super accelerated version of that. i mean, you don't always improve, but you can aspire to improve. you can aspire to be less wrong. yeah, this is, like, i think, a good. the tools of physics are very powerful. like, just assume you're wrong and you're asking your goals to be less wrong. i don't think you're gonna if you succeed every day and being less wrong, but you know, if you're gonna succeed in being less wrong most of the time, you're doing great. that's a great way of putting aspire to be less wrong. but then when you know people look back at nostalgia about simpler times, there's that too. it's very romantic and exciting to look back on campfires, but you can still have a campfire. yes, yeah, but will you appreciate it when you're a super nerd, when you're connected to the grid and you have some uh skull cap in place of the top of your head and it's interfacing with the inter international language, that the rest of the universe now enjoys communication with people and we're? yeah, sure, i think so. yeah, i like empires [Laughter]. i'm just worried. i mean, uh, everyone's always scared of change, but i'm scared of this monumental change where we won't, we won't talk anymore. i mean, that thing will communicate, yes, but that's there's something about. there's something about the beauty of the crudeness of language where, when it's done eloquently, it's, it's, it's satisfying and it it it hits us in some sort of a visceral way like, ah, that person nailed it. i love that they nailed it like that. it's so hard to capture a real thought and convey it in a way, in this articulate way, that makes someone, except like you, read a quote, a great quote by a wise person. it makes you excited that their mind figured something out, put the words together in a right way, that makes your brain pop like, oh, yes, yeah, yes, it's clever compression of a concept, yeah, and a feeling. but the fact that a human did it too, yeah, absolutely. do you think that it'll be like electronic music, like people won't appreciate it like they appreciate a slide guitar. i like electronic music, i do too. yeah, well, you make it. i know you liked it. yeah, yeah, yeah, um, yeah, i mean i hope the future is more fun and interesting and we should try to make that way. i hope it's more fun and interesting too. yeah, i just, you know, i just hope you don't lose anything along the way. yeah, we might at least little, but hopefully we'll gain more than lose. yeah, that's the thing, right, gaining more than we lose, like something that makes us interesting is that we're so flawed- it's not for sure, right? yeah, i mean, you look at civilizations through the ages: um, most of them, uh, you know, they rose and fell, yeah, and uh, i do think, like the globalization, uh, that that we have at the sort of like the, the meme sphere, uh, is, uh, there's not enough isolation between countries or regions. um, it's like, if you get up, if there's a mind virus, that that my virus cannot infect too much of the world. uh, you know, like i actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people because it's it's like man, we don't ever want everywhere to be the same for sure, and then we, we need some kind of like mind viral immunity. so that that's. it's a bit concerning mind viral immunity, meaning that once something like neural link gets established, the real concern is something that i mean you said it's bluetooth, right, or some future version of that- that- the idea is that something could possibly get into it [ __ ] it up. no, i'm talking about, like, uh, somebody. there's some cockeyed concept that, um, that's happened, that happens right right now. yeah, well, i know there's viruses and embedded chips, right, like people have, they've embedded chips and then acquired viruses. well, when i'm talking about my verse, i'm talking about like a, a concept that affects people's minds. oh, okay, okay, like, uh, cult thinking or, yeah, some sort of fundamentalism. yeah, just wrong-headed idea that, yes, goes viral in a, in an idea sense [Music]. well, that is, that is a problem too, right, if someone can manipulate that technology to make something appear logical or rational, yeah, yeah, that would that be an issue too with this is a very have versus have not issue right once, this thing, if, if this really does, i mean initially it's going to help people with, with injuries, and but you, you said, ultimately it could lead to this spectacular cognitive change. yes, but the people that first get it should have a massive advantage over people that don't have it yet. well, i mean, it's the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, i don't know dramatically, maybe by a factor of 10, with it. so you could definitely just- you know, uh, i don't know- take out a loan and do it and earn, earn the money back real fast. so you're super smart. well, in a capitalist society, you know, you could. it seems like you could really get so far ahead that, before everybody else could afford this thing and link up and get connected as well, you'd be so far ahead. they could never catch you. is that a concern? uh, well, i think the, the it's not a super huge concern. i mean, there are huge differences in cognitive ability and and resources already. yeah, um, i mean you can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective. uh, that's far smarter than an individual like i. i can personally build like a whole rocket and and the engines and launch it and everything. that's impossible, uh, but you know, we have eight thousand people with spacex and you might, you know, piecing it out to different people. um, and using, like you know, computers and machines and stuff. we can make, lots of rockets launch and all, but stuck with the space station, that kind of thing you know, um, so that already exists where this, you know, where there's a, corporations are vastly more capable than an individual. um, but the, the like we should be, i think, less concerned about like relative capabilities between people and and more like uh, having ai be vastly, you know, beyond us and decoupled from human will, decoupled from human. so this is the, if you can't beat them, join them, yeah, i mean. so you feel like it's inevitable, like ai, sentient ai is essentially inevitable. super sentient ai, yeah, like beyond a level that's difficult to understand and impossible to understand, probably, and somehow or another us. so it's almost like it's a requirement for survival to achieve some sort of symbiotic existence with ai. it's not a requirement, it's just um, if you, if you want to be along for the ride, then you need to do some kind of symbiosis. so the, the way your brain works right now, you've got uh, kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of, let's say it's like the limbic system, basically, and you've got the, the cortex. um, now the brain- purists will argue with this definition, but essentially you've got the primitive brain and you've got the, the sort of smart brain or the brain that's capable of planning and understanding concepts and different difficult, you know, things that a monkey can't understand. um, now the, your cortex, is much, much smarter than your olympic system. um, nonetheless, they work together well. so i haven't met anyone who wants to delete the olympic system or the cortex that. people are quite happy having both. um, so you can think of the this as being like the computer. the ai is like a, a third layer, a tertiary layer. so that is like that could be symbiotic with the cortex. it'd be much smarter than the cortex, but you'd essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now. your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable things that your brain is definitely not. you know storing your terabytes of information perfectly, um, doing incredible calculations that you, you know we couldn't even come close to doing. you have that with your computer. it's just like i said: the data rate is slow, the connection is weak. why is it so disconcerting? or why is it? why does it not give me comfort to think about? like? when i think about a symbiotic connection to ai, i always think of this cold, emotionless sort of thing that we will become. is that a bad way to look at it? i don't think that's not. that's not quite. that's not how it would be like i said you, you already are, yeah, symbiotic with ai or computers, phones, computers, laptops, yeah, and there's, there's quite a bit of ai going on. you know, near. so artificial neural nets. um, increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more. so you are connected. um, you know, if you use google voice or alexa or one of those things, it's using a neural net to decode your speech and try to understand what you're saying. um, you know, if, if you're trying to image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, it's it's using the neural nets the best way to do that. so, um, you are already, uh, sort of a sort of a cybernetic symbiote. it, like said you when, that it's just a question of your data rate, the, the, the communication speed between your, your phone and your brain is slow. when do you think you're gonna do it? how long will you wait? um, like, once it starts becoming available? yeah, if it works, i'll do it, sure, right away. i mean, let's make sure it works. how do we make sure it works. we're trying on prisoners like what do you do? no, no, you take rapists, no, cut holes in your head. now, like i said, if somebody's got a serious brain injury right, um, and though you know people have like very severe brain injuries, um, and then, and then you can fix those, those brain injuries, um, and you know, then you prove out that it works and you expand, envelope, expand and make more and more brain injuries, uh, sold more and more, um, and that you know, suddenly at certain age we all are are going to get alzheimer's, we're all going to get senile, um, and then you know, moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing, and so you know it's like you said: okay, well, you know, this would allow you to remember your names, your kids and, and, and have a normal, a much more normal life where you, you, you're able to function much later in life, um, so i think that, so essentially, that there would almost everyone would find a need at some point if, if you get old enough to use your neural link and and, and then it's like: okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communications, communication speed, so then you will not have to use your thumbs to communicate with the computer. do you ever sit down, extrapolate? do you ever like sit down and think about all the different iterations of this and what this eventually leads to? um, yeah, i mean, i think sure, think about a lot. um, there's, like i said, this is not something that's going to sneak up on you, you know. there's like getting fda approval for this stuff is not like overnight. you know, um, and this there's. i mean, we probably have to be on like version 10 or something before you know it. it would realistically be, um, you know, a human ai symbiote situation. so you'll see it coming. you know, you see it coming. but what do you think it's going to be like when you sit, when you're alone, if you have free time? i don't know if you have free time, but if you just sit down and think about this iteration, the next onward, keep going and you, you drag it out with improvements along the way and leaps and bounds and technological innovations, and where do you see it? what are we going to be like when, 20, 25 years from now? what are we going to be? well, assuming civilization is still around, um, it's looking fragile right now. um, i think we, i think we could have a in 25 years, probably something. i think, like that could be a whole brain interface. a whole brain interface, sorry, pretty close to that. yeah, how does how do you define? what do you mean by whole brain interface? um, like, almost all the neurons are connected to, uh, you're the sort of ai extension of yourself. if you want ai extension of yourself, yeah, what does that mean to you? like? when you say ai extension of yourself, well, you like i said you already have a computer extension of yourself in your phone, you know, and computers and stuff. so, and now, online, it's like somebody dies. there's this like an online ghost that they're- they're still their online stuff. yeah, it's alive. that's a good way to put it. it is weird when you read someone's tweets after they're dead. yeah, yeah, instagram and their stories and stuff, yeah, whatever facebook inside you know, like, that's a great way to put it. it's like an online ghost. that's very accurate. yeah, so, yeah, so there's. it would just be that that more of you would be in the cloud, i guess, than in your body. more of it, more of you. whoa, now, when you say civilization's fragile, do you mean because of this covet 19 [ __ ] that's going on right now. what's that? i've never heard of it. it's this thing, yeah, no, it's like, uh, some people just get a card, other people it gets much worse. uh, sure, yeah, well, yeah, i mean, this certainly has taken over the mayan space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking. yeah, well, out of nowhere. that's what's crazy. it's like you go back to november: nothing. now here we are: december, january, february, march, april, may- six months- totally different world. so, from nothing to everything's locked down. there's so much, uh, conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed. what, what has happened? you, you find things where there was a meat packing plant, i believe, in missouri, where 300 plus people were asymptomatic, tested positive or asymptomatic, and then in other places it just ravages entire communities and kills people and it's it's so weird. it almost appears on the out like if you didn't know any better, you'd be like what. it seems like there's a bunch of different viruses. it doesn't seem like it's the same thing or has a bunch of different reactions to the biological variety of of people. yeah, um, i mean, i kind of saw this whole thing play out in china, uh, before it played out in the us. so, um, it's kind of like watching the same movie again, but in english, um, so, yeah, um, i might. i think the, the, the, the mortality rate is much less than what is. then what say the world health organization said it was it's very much module assets, like, probably at least order of magnitude less. well, it seems to be very deadly to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems. yeah, i mean, if you're, you can look at the mortality statistics, you know, by age and whether they have comorbid, comorbidities, like do they have, like basically, existing conditions and um, by age, um and uh, you know, if you're below 60 and and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low. it's not zero, but it's extremely low. they didn't think that this was the case, though, when they first started to lock down the country. do you think that it's a situation where, once they've proceeded in a certain way, it's very difficult to correct course? it's almost like people really wanted a panic. that you know quite, quite crazy. but in some places a panic is deserved right, like if you're in the icu in manhattan and people are dying left and right and everyone's on intubators and it's, it's. it seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of them are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick, in some places that fear is justified, but then in other places you're reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty. they're they're having to furlough doctors and nurses because there's no work for them. most of the hospitals in the united states right now half empty. in some cases they're at 30 capacity. and is this because they've decided to forego elective procedures and and normal things that people would have to go to the hospital for? yes, i mean, we're not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important. like it's like you have about a lot of disease, yeah, sure, and you need a- you know, triple bypass. it's like sort of elective, but if you don't get it done in time, it's you're gonna die. yeah, it's, elective is a weird word. yeah, elective it's not like hey, i, i want to. it's not like plastic surgery. it's more like like my, my hip is, i'm in extreme pain because my, my hips blown out or my knee and i don't want to go to the hospital. i can't go to the hospital, to you know, people in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, you know, like people that have, like, quite serious issues, that are choosing not to go out of fear. um, so i think it's, it's a problem, it's not good. it seems like the state of public perception is shifting. it is like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and because of the statistics of, i mean, and essentially across the board, it's being recognized that it's not as fatal as we thought. it was. still dangerous, still worse than the flu, but not as bad as we thought or we feared it could be. i mean, objectively, the mortality is is much lower, like at least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought. do you think that the current way we're handling this- the social distancing, the mass, the locking down- is it? does this make sense? is it adequate, or do you think that we should move back to at least closer to where we used to be? well, i think proper hygiene is a good thing, no matter what. you know, wash your hands, and you know. and if you're, if you're, coughing, stay home or wear a mask. this is not good, you know. um, like they do that in japan that's like normal if you're, if you're ill, you you wear a face mask and you don't cough on people. i think that that would be a great thing to to adopt in general throughout the world. um, washing your hands is also good. well, that's the speculation, why men get it more than women? because men are disgusting and we don't watch that. disgusting, it's true. it's true. yeah, we're all my men in this room. we're all gross. yeah, let's go to the restroom. you can see us. yes, we're gross. my daughter, my nine-year-old daughter, yells at me. she goes: did you wash your hands? she makes me go back and wash my hands. hmm, she's right, nine years old. if i had a nine-year-old boy, do you think he would care? i wouldn't give a [ __ ] if i wash my hands, true, um, so, yeah, i think that there's definitely some silver linings here than in improved uh, you know, uh- hygiene, yeah, and an awareness of potential. yes, and i think this has shaken up the, the system, uh system is like somewhat more bond with la la's layers of bureaucracy and i think that we've cut through some of that bureaucracy, uh, and if we, you know, at some point there probably will be a? uh, pandemic with, with a, with a high mortality rate, uh, debate about like what's high, but i mean like someone that's killing a lot of 20 year olds. let's say like it's yeah, if you had like ebola type of mortality, spanish flu, something that uh, tax immune systems of healthy people, yeah, yeah, um, yeah, but it's a yeah, like like killing large numbers of young, healthy people, that that's. you know, define that as like uh, uh, high mortality. then that this is at least practice for something like that. um, and i think there's this, you know, given it's just a matter of time that there will be eventually some, some such pandemic, do you think that, in a sense, the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is a potential reality, that we, we got lucky in this sense, i mean in people that didn't get lucky and died? of course, i'm not disrespecting their death and their loss, but i'm saying, overall, as a, as a culture, as a community, as a human race, as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been. this is a good dry run for us to appreciate that we need far more resources dedicated towards the, the understanding these diseases, what to do in the case of pandemic, and much more money that goes to funding treatments and and some preventative measures. yeah, absolutely, um, and i think, i think there's a good chance- it's highly likely, i think- coming out of this, that we will develop uh vaccines that we didn't have before- uh for uh quran viruses and other other viruses, um, and and possibly cures uh for for these, and our understanding of uh viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it's received. so there's definitely some- you know, a lot- of silver linings here, um, and potentially, if we act correctly, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's uh, i think there will be some amounts of lighting here, no matter what, um, hopefully it can be more professive lighting than less, yeah, um. so, yeah, this is, this is uh. it's like kind of like a practice run for something that had that, that had a potential, that might, in the future, have a serious uh like a really high mortality rate, that, and we kind of got to go through this with without, without it being something that kills, you know, vast numbers of young, healthy people. yeah, when you made a series of tweets recently, uh, you know, uh- i don't remember the exact wording, but essentially, you were saying: free america, now, like, let's think about that, is it? thank you. but uh, the, the. you know what was the? how much do you pay attention to the response to that stuff? and what was the response? like, did anybody go? hey, elon, what the [ __ ] you doing? did anybody pull you aside? who does that? who gets to do that to you? well, i mean, i certainly get that. there's no shortage of negative feedback on twitter. you know, oh, yeah, twitter, yeah, but i don't read that. do you read it? warzone? you do sometimes, though, right, you do read it. yeah, i mean, scroll through the comments like as a meme. warzone, yeah, i mean, people, knife, you're good. it's something i i enjoy about that. just, the. there's a something about the, the freedom of expression that comes from all these people that do attack you. it's like, well, they, if there was no vulnerability whatsoever, they wouldn't attack you. and it's like there's something about these millions and millions of perspectives that you, you have to, you have to appreciate, even if it comes your way, even if the [ __ ] storm hits you in the face, sure you gotta appreciate. wow, how amazing is it that all these people do have the ability to express themselves. you don't don't necessarily want to be there when the [ __ ] hits. you sure you might want to get out of the way in anticipation of the [ __ ] storm, but the fact that so many people have the ability to reach out, and i think it's in a lot of ways, it's uh, i don't wanna say a misused resource, but it's like giving monkeys guns: they just start, they start gunning down things that in front of them, without any realization of what they're doing. they have a rock, they see a window, they throw it. whoa, look at that. i got elon madd. look at that. this guy got mad at me. this, this, i i [ __ ] took this person down on twitter. i got this lady fired. oh, the [ __ ] business is going under because of twitter wars. it seems like there's something about it. that's this newfound thing that, uh, i want to say abuse. but just, i want to say that it's almost like you know, you hit the button and things blow up. you're like, wow, this is what else can we blow up, sure? um, i mean, i've been in the twitter war zone for for a while here, so put your war zone. you know, take. it takes a lot to phase me at this point. yeah, that's good too, right, like you develop a thick skin. yeah, you can't take it personally. these people don't like actually know you. you know like. yeah, it's just like you know. so it's like if you're, if you're, fighting a war and there's like some opposing soldier that that shoots, shoots at you, it's not like they hate you, they don't even know you, right, yeah, yeah, so just think of it like that, like they're firing bullets or whatever, um, but they don't know you, so don't take it personally. there's something interesting about it too. it's like, uh, like, when you write something in you know 280 characters and they write something into it. it's such a crude way. it's like you know someone's saying sending opposing smoke signals that refute your smoke signals. it's like it's so crude and especially when you're talking about something like neural link, he's talking about some future potential where you're going to be able to express pure thoughts that get get conveyed through some sort of a universal language with no ambiguity whatsoever versus, you know, tweets. well, there'll always be some ambiguity, but yeah, tweets are. it's hard. um, like the. maybe there should be like a sarcasm flag or something you know, right, right, um, or i'm not, you know, just kidding, or whatever you know like, don't you know? it seems like it would take away some of the fun from people that know. it's sarcasm, like if everybody knew that the onion wasn't real. if you sent people articles- yeah, is something about someone getting angry at an onion article- wow, that's amazing. you know what i mean- where they don't realize what it is. there's something fun about that. for everybody else, uh, yeah, i know, it's pretty great. it might be the best news source. do you know who titania mcgrath is? hilario? it's, uh, andrew boyle. he's a, uh, a british fellow, a brilliant guy who's been on the podcast before, and he has this uh fictional character, this uh pseudonym. titania mcgrath, who's, like this all the ultimate social justice warrior? is this like, like a female avatar? a female avatar that's actually a computer conglomeration of a bunch of faces. okay, it's not really one person, so one person can't be a victim and be angry. he's sort of combined these faces to make this one perfect social justice more okay, but the thing like, i recognized it early on, before i met him. sure that this was parody, this is, this was just fun. and then i love reading the people that don't recognize that. they get angry, sure, and then they're really really like. there's a lot of people that just get really furious. sure, about some of some fun to that. there's some fun to the. not picking up on the, the, the true nature of the signal. i find twitter quite engaging. how do you have the time? um, well, i mean, it's like five minutes every couple hours type of thing. it's not like i'm sitting on an old day, but even five minutes every couple hours, if those are bad five minutes, they might be bouncing around your head for the next 30.. yeah, you have to. you know, like i said, take a certain amount of distance from you. read this and you're like: okay, it's bullets being fired by an opposing army. you know, don't like it. it's not like they, they like. so it's not like they know you. it's like, don't take it personally. um, did you feel the same way when, when cnn had that stupid [ __ ] about ventilators with you? i, i found that both confusing and the, the, the. yeah, that was annoying. it was annoying, but what is also annoying as a person who reads cnn and wants to think of them as a responsible conveyor of the facts. i would like to think that, yeah, i don't think cnn is that. i think he used to be. he used to be, yeah, um, like, what do you think's the the best source of, just like, information out there? that's a good question. you know, like, let's say, you're just like average citizen trying to just get the facts. you know, figure out what's going on, like, you know how to live your life and you know, just looking for what, what's going on in the world, that it's hard to find something that that isn't. you know that's that that's good. yeah, you know, uh, that you know not not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to not not sort of doing sloppy reporting and and just aiming for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing. yeah, you're just trying to figure out what's going on. it's like i'm hard pressed. where do you go? i don't know. i don't think there's any pure form. my favorite places are the new york times and the la times and i don't trust them 100 percent, you know, because also there's individuals that are writing these stories exactly and that's seems to be the problems: these individual biases and these individual. there's purposely distorted perceptions, and then there's ignorantly reported facts and there's so many variables and you got to put everything through this filter of: where is this person coming from? do they have political biases? do they have social biases? do they are they? are they upset because of their own shortcomings? and they are they projecting this into the story? sure, it's so hard. yeah, i think, like maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and yeah, kind of falling down as opposed to the publication. i go with whatever matt taibbi says. okay, i trust him more than anybody. all right, matt taib, he's onto something. i just he's as far as investigative reporters in particular, the way he reported the savings and loan crisis, the way he reports everything. i just i just listen to him above most, above mo. he's my go-to guy. all right, i'll check it out. uh, it's rolling stone's articles or his stuff on the savings alone crisis, just like what in the [ __ ]. and you know, and he wasn't, you know, he's not an economist by any stretch of the imagination, so he had to really sort of deeply embed himself in that world to try to understand it and to be able to report on it, and was also with a humorous flair- for now that's nice, yeah, um, yeah, but it's not that many of them there's. it's hard- and not a location where, like, we are no [ __ ], that's right, you know, we are no bullshitcom- like the one place where you can say: this is what we know, this is what we don't know, this is what we think, not this person's wrong, and here's why, like, oh god damn it, you know, i can't, you, you don't know. there's a lot of stuff that is open to interpretation. yeah, this, this particular coronavirus issue that we're dealing with right now, seems to be a great illuminator of that very. fact is that there's so much data and there's this, so there's so much that's open to interpret. there's so many thing because it's all happening in real time, right and like, particularly right now in california we're in stage two. tomorrow or friday, two days from now, stage two retail stores opening up. things are changing like when no one knows the correct process that needs to take place to save the most amount of lives but yet ensure that our, our culture and that our, our, our economy survives. it's a lot of speculation and guessing, but if you go to certain places, they'll tell you. we know why and we know this and we know, uh, it's hard. yeah, i mean, i, in general, i think that's like we should be concerned about, um, anything that's a massive infringement on our civil, civil liberties. yes, you know. so it's like you got to put a lot of weight on that. um, you know, people, a lot of people died to, you know, win independence with the country and and fight for the democracy that we have and, uh, you know, we should treasure that and not and not give up our liberties too easily. i think we've, we, i mean, i think we probably did that actually. well, i like what you said when you said that it should be a choice and that to require people to stay home, require people to not go to work, require and to to arrest people for trying to make a living, this all seems wrong and i think it's a wrong approach. it's a, it's uh, you're, you're, it's an infantilization of the society. that daddy's going to tell you what to do. fundamentally, a violation of the constitution, yeah, freedom of assembly, and you know it's just. i mean, i don't think these things stand up in court. really. they're arresting people for protesting, yeah, yeah, because they're protesting and violating social distancing and these mandates that tell people that they have to stay home. yeah, these, these are these- would definitely not stand up. uh, you know, if the supreme court here i mean it's obviously a complete violation, right, yeah, yeah, and again, this is not in any way, um, disrespecting the people who have died from this disease. that's certainly a real thing to think of. yeah, i mean it. it it just should be if, if you're, if you're at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house, right, um, or leave a place of safety, but you should also not be, uh, if you're not at risk, or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life, you should have the right to do that, and it seems like, at this point in time, particularly, our resources would be best served protecting the people that are at risk versus penalizing the people that are not at high risk for living their life the way they did, particularly having a career and and making a living and feeding your family, paying your bills, keeping your store open, keeping your restaurant open. yes, i mean, there's there's a strong, a strong downside to this, yeah, so, yeah, i just believe, like you know, if this is a free country, you should be. you know a lot allowed to do. you know what you want, as long as it does not endanger others. but that's the thing, right? people- this is the argument they will bring up- like you are endangering others. you should stay home for the people that that you, even if you're fine, even if you know you're gonna be okay, there's certain people that will not be okay because of your actions. they might get exposed to this thing that we don't have a vaccine for, we don't have universally accepted treatment for, and then we need to ca. this is. there's two arguments, right? the one argument is: we need to keep going, protect the weak, protect the sick, but let's open up the economy. the other argument is: stop placing money over human lives and let's shelter in place until we come up with some sort of a decision and let's figure out some way to develop some sort of universal income, universal basic income plan or something like that to feed people during the, during this time when we make this transition. i think there's a yeah, um, as i said, right, yeah. my opinion is if, if somebody wants to stay home, they should stay home and say something: doesn't want to stay home. they should not be compelled to stay home. that's my opinion, do you think? if somebody doesn't like that, well, that's my opinion. um, so the now, yeah, um, the the. this notion though, that, uh, you know, you can just sort of send checks out everybody and and things will be fine. it's not true, obviously, um, the there's. some people have this absurd like a view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty, like it, it just makes stuff, stuff, you know, whatever it. just there's a magic quarter plenty and the goods and services they just come from this magic corner plenty. and then if um, like, if somebody has more stuff than somebody else's because they took more from this magic corner plenty, now let me uh just break it to uh the fools out there: if you don't make stuff, there's no stuff, yeah. so if you don't make the food, if you don't process the food- you know transport the food and what the, whether you know medical treatment, getting getting your teeth fixed- there's no stuff. i become detached from reality. you can't just legislate money and solve these things. if you don't make stuff, there is no stuff. obviously we'll run out of the stores, run out of the. you know, it's the whole. the machine just grinds to a halt. but the the initial thought on this virus, the real fear, was that this was going to kill hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people instantaneously in this country. it was going to do it very quickly if we didn't hunker down, if we didn't shelter in place, if we didn't quarantine ourselves or lock down. do you think that the initial thought was a good idea, based on the perception that this was going to be far more deadly than it turned out to be? maybe, i think. briefly, briefly, briefly, but uh, i think, if you know any, any kind of like sensible examination of what happened in china would lead to the conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur. uh, this, this virus, originated in wuhan. there's, like i don't know, hundred thousand people a day leaving on. uh, so it that, that, it, it, uh, it went everywhere very fast, through throughout china, throughout the rest of the world, um, and the fatality rate was, was, low. don't you think, though it's difficult to appreciate it's, it's it's difficult to filter what the information is coming out of china to accurately really get a real, true representation of what happened? the, the propaganda machine is very strong, sure, what the world health organization appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda. the thing is that american companies have massive supply chains in china, like tesla, for example. we have hundreds of suppliers like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout, throughout china. so we know if they are able to make stuff or not. we know if they, if they, have issues or not, then they they're. china is back back at full steam. um, and until many, uh, pretty much every us company has some significant number of flies in china. so you know, you know if they're able to, you know, provide things or not, or if there's, you know, high mortality rate. tesla has seven thousand people in china, so zero people died, um, zero, okay, so that that's a real statistic that's coming from? yeah, yeah, you know those people. yeah, we, literally we're in payroll. do you think there's a danger of this? same folks are there, yeah, do you think there's a danger of politicizing this, whereas becomes like opening up the country's? uh, donald trump's, it's his goal, it's his, and then anything he does is sort of: uh, there's, there's people that are going to oppose it and come up with some reasons why he's wrong, particularly in this climate, whereas, as we're leading up november and, you know, the, the 2020 elections. do you think that this is a real danger in terms of, uh, public's perception that trump wants to open it up, so they knee-jerk oppose it because they oppose trump? i, i think there has been some politician. this has been politicized, you know, in both directions really. so it's, um, which is not great, yeah, but, like i said, separate. apart from that, i think there's the question of, like, you know, where do several civil liberties fit in this picture? you know, yeah and uh, what, what, what can the government make you do? what can they make you not do? and what, you know, what's, what's okay, right, um and uh, yeah, i think we went too far. do you think it's one of those things where, once we've gone in a certain direction, it's very difficult to make a correction, make a, an adjustment to, to realize, like, okay, we thought it was one thing, it's not, it's not good, but it's not what we thought it was going to be, it's not what we feared. so, let's, let's back up and reconsider, let's do this publicly and say we were acting based on the information that we had initially. that information appears to be faulty and, uh, here's how we move forward while protecting civil liberties, while protecting what essentially this country was founded on, which is a very agreed upon amount of freedom. yeah, that we respect and appreciate absolutely well, i think we're we're rapidly moving towards opening up the country. um, it's going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks. so, yeah, something that would be helpful, just add from an informational level is, um, when reporting uh sort of covet cases to separate out diagnosed with covert versus uh had covert like symptoms. yes, because the list of symptoms that could be covered at this point is like a mile long, so it's like a hard to if you're ill at all. it's like it could be covered. so, just just to give people better information: definitely, diagnosed with covert or had covered like symptoms, we're conflating those two so that one that it looks bigger than it is. then, uh, if somebody dies is: was covert a a primary cause of the death or not? uh, i mean, if i mean if somebody has kova, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has covered, it's gonna get recorded as a cover death. is that real? basically not that bad. but heart attacks, strokes, you get hit by a bug, cancer if you, if you get hit by a bus, go to the, go to the hospital and die and then find that you have covered, you will be recorded as a cover death. why would they do that though? well, right now, the- so you know the road is hell- is the. rotel is paid with good intentions. i mean, he's mostly paid with bad intentions, but there's, you know, some good intentions, saving stones in there too. um, and the, the, the stimulus bill that was intended to help, uh, with the hospitals that were being overrun with with, with code patients, uh created an incentive to record something as covet that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital is going bankrupt for lack of other patients. so the hospitals are in a bind. right now there's a bunch of hospitals, are they're following doctors, as you were mentioning? they're, you know they're, your is half full, you're. it's hard, hard to make ends meet. so now you've got like you know, if i just check this box, i get eight thousand dollars. put on a ventilator for five minutes, i get thirty nine thousand dollars back, or or i to fire some doctors. so what's the? what's this? this is a tough moral quandary. it's like what you can do. that's the situation. we have no, what. what's the way out of this? what do you think is like if, if you had the president's ear or if people wanted to just listen to you openly? what do you think is the way out of this? so let's, let's clear up the data. clear up the data. so, like i said, uh, something should be required as code, but only if it is: uh, somebody has been tested, uh, has received a positive, positive cover test. not if they simply have symptoms, one of like 100 symptoms, and then if, if it is a cover death, it must be separated. or was this was coveted, a primary, primary reason for death? or did they also have stage three cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by a bus and had covered? yeah, i've read all this stuff about that, about them, uh, diagnosing people as a covet death, despite other variables. this is not a. this is not a. this is not a, a question. this is what is occurring. and where are you reading this from? where are you getting this from? the public health health officials have literally said this: this is not, this is not a question mark, right? but this is never. this is unprecedented, right? like if someone had the flu but also had a heart attack, they would assume that that person died of a heart attack. yes, yeah, so this is unprecedented. is this because this is such a a popular- i don't- i don't want to use that word the wrong way, but that's what i mean- a popular subject and financial incentives, yes, and like so this is not some sort of it a moral indictment of of sort of hospital administrators, it's just they're in it, they're, they're in a in a tough, in a tough spot here. um, they actually don't have enough patience to to pay everyone for it to with, without following, following doctors and and firing staff and yeah, they're running, potentially going bankrupt. so so then they're like, okay, well, the stimulus bill says, if you know, we get all this, you know money. if we say if, if they, if it's a cover death, i'm like, okay, they coughed before they died. in fact, they're not even diagnosed with cover. they simply, if you had weakness, a cough, uh, shortness of breath, but frankly, i'm not sure how you die without those things. yeah, you, yeah, but there's so many different things that you could attribute to covet too. there's so many symptoms. there's diarrhea, headaches, dehydration. yeah, cough, yes, but to be clear, you, you don't even need to have gotten a cover diagram. you simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it's covered. so then it makes the death count look very high and then we're then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count's super high and not going down like it should be and now? so then we, we should keep whatever you know, keep, you know, the shelter in place, stuff there, and and keep people in their home. you know, confined people to homes. so we need to break out of this, this. we're stuck in a loop, yeah, and i think the way to break out of this loop is to have clarity of information. clarity of information will certainly help, but altering perceptions, public perception from people that are basically in a panic, there's a lot of essentially well, at least a month ago we're clearly in a panic. i mean right, where you know, when you look around, april 5th, april 6th, people were really freaking out. but here we are, may and may, people are relaxing a little bit. yes, they're realizing like, hey, um, i actually know a couple of people that got it- it was just a cough- and i know some people that got it where nothing happened. i know a lot of people have got it. i know zero people who died, that i mean about. no, yeah, a lot of people got it. yeah, it's. it's not what we feared. we feared something much worse. yeah, that's correct. so the adjustment's difficult to make. so you said, first of all, we need real data. we need just just parse out the data. don't, don't lump it all together, no. and then, if, if you give, if you get people, just parse out the data better, clear, clearer information, um, about, uh, like i said, was this an actual code of a diagnosis or was it a? or did they get the test and the test came back positive, or do they just have some symptoms? just parse those two out, um, and then parse out, just, uh, if somebody died, did they die? did they? did they even have a covet test? or or did they just have one of many symptoms? like, like, like, how do you die without weakness? i don't know right, it's impossible. basically, yeah, it's a good point. if you're gonna die, you're gonna have shortness of breath, weakness and you might cough a little, um, so so was it quantified? what was it? yeah, that person, did they actually have a covert test? and, and the tests come back positive and then, um, if, if they died, did they uh, die where? where covert was? um, it didn't have to be the main course, but it was a significant contributor to their death, or was it not a significant contributor to the death? right, it's not as simple as just because you had covet, covet killed you definitely not, right? yeah? yeah, i mean, people die all the time and they have like flu and, yes, you know other colds, and well, we don't say that they died of those flu and other colds. well, that's what's so weird. absolutely, it's so popular- and i use that word in a weird way, but it's so popular that we've kind of forgotten. people die pneumonia every day. yeah, people die of the flu. didn't take a break. oh, kovitz got this. i'm gonna sit this one out. i'm gonna be on the bench, i'm gonna wait until kovitz done before i jump back into the game of killing people. no, the flu is still here. killing people, i mean ev. every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu. yeah, not, not tangentially, right, not every 61 000 in this country last year, yeah, and we're only five percent of the world. and then there's cigarettes. so, oh man, cigarettes- not cigarettes- will really kill you. that's a weird one, right? we're terrified of this disease. that were projected it could potentially kill 100, if not 200 000 americans this year with cigarettes kill 500 000 and you don't hear a peep out of any politician. there's no one running for congress is trying to ban cigarettes. there's no one running for senate that wants to put some education plan in place. it's going to stop cigarettes in their tracks. yeah, i mean a long time, like several years ago, i mean along with 10, 10 years ago i helped make a movie cold thank you for smoking. oh, i saw that. yeah, um it it, yeah, um, yeah, it's crazy. uh, smoking barbecuing alongside just bad news. it's not not good. you know you're turning your lungs into smoke, smoked beef and not great. um, so, um, yeah, tylenol, by the way, also kills a lot of people. yeah, what is the number for tylenol over here? um, i'm not sure the exact number, but i believe it. until the opioid crisis, i believe tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs. um, because, wow, basically it's. uh, if you have, if you get drunk and take a lot of tylenol, um, acetaminophen, essentially it causes liver failure, so sevilla would like get get wasted and then like have a headache and then pop a tonic. tylenol gardens- whoa, yeah, curtains is a funny word. yeah, you know so, but nobody's, like you know, raging against tylenol. yeah, it's weird. except acceptable deaths are weird, and that's the real, the slippery slope about this: uh, people shaming people for wanting to go back to work. you know other people are gonna die. well, if you drive, do you drive? oh well, you should stop driving because people die from driving. so you know, you definitely should fill up all the swimming pools because like 50 people die every day in this country from swimming. so let's not swim anymore. yeah, what is the really dangerous? we need to chop down all the coconuts. coconuts kill 150 people every year. yes, cut down all the coconut trees. we need those people. yes, it's at a certain point in time. it's like we, yeah, we're vulnerable and we're also we, we're also, we have a finite existence. no matter what we do, nobody lives forever, right, um, i mean the, the, the, i mean. i think you want to look at, say, deaths as like the, but for this, uh, disease, whatever, they would have lived x number of years. yeah, you know so. um, you know, if somebody dies when they're they're they're 20 and could live till 80, they they lost 60 years. but if somebody dies when they're 80 and they might live until 81, they last one year. yes, so it's, it's like how many life years were lost? uh, is is a? probably you know the right metric to use. i don't, uh read my own comments, but i do read other people's comments, and i was reading this one little twitter beef that was going on where someone was saying that kovid takes an average of 10 years off people's lives and we should appreciate those 10 years, and then someone else said that's not true. i'm sure it's not true. yeah, definitely it's the twitter. but someone else said the average age of people who die from covid is older than the average age people die. it's very, let's say, just say it's like it's, it's about the same. that's a beautiful way of looking at it. i mean it's, it's unfortunate, it sucks, but it sucks. if grandpa dies of alzheimer's or emphysema or leukemia, it sucks. sure, it sucks when someone you love dies, yes, but i, i'm i mean actually if, if this, uh, i think a lesson to be taken here that i think is quite important is that if, um, if you have, you know, your great grandparents and their, their age and grandparents, really be careful with uh, with, with, uh, you know, any kind of flu or cold or something that that wouldn't is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous too. to help the elderly is, um, if, basically, if your kids got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is. it's, it's, uh, the things that are, where a young immune system is has no problem and an older one has, has a problem. yeah and um, in fact, a lot of the, a lot of the deaths are just, are literally, it's tragic, but they're, they're intra family, um, it's the, the, the little little kid had it, had a, you know, called or flew and give it to grandpa. yeah, yeah, they have the family gathering and they don't know that this is a big deal, but it's, it's just important to remember. when you get older, your immune system is just not that strong and uh, and and so just be be careful with your, with, with your you know loved ones or elderly, and i think there is some true objective, um, understanding of the immune system and the ways to boost that immune system, and i really think that that that information should be, that should be distributed in a way, a non-judgmental way, but like, look, this is, this is a way that we can all like. this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life, and it might save the life of your loved ones, and maybe we could teach this to our grandparents and our parents and and people that are vulnerable. you know, vitamin c, heat, shock, proteins- all these different variables that we know contribute to a stronger immune system. yeah, um, actually, just um, a thing that that is is is tough. uh, if, like, when you, as you get older, it's, it's hard to be- you pretend to put on weight. you know, i, certainly that's happening with me. you know, like, as the older i get, i'm like, damn, it's harder to stay lean. uh, that's for sure. um, and and so actually being being overweight is is a big deal. yeah, just uh, it's a fact. uh, well, yeah, the new york hospital said it was the number one factor for severe, uh, kovid symptoms was obesity. that was number one factor. it is that that's, yes, exactly, but it's also we live in a world where people want to be sensitive to other people's feelings. so, yeah, absolutely, we don't want to bring up the fact that being fat's bad for you. it's a judgment on your food's great. yeah, i do love food. yeah, and i mean, i mean to be totally frank, i mean speaking for myself- i'd, i'd rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life, yeah, you know, yeah, those moments of enjoying a great meal, yeah, and then even talking about they're valuable, they're worth something, yeah, it's not. we don't want to eat soylent green and live to be 160.. tasty, if it was great, one of the best things about life, it really is. yeah, it's an art form as well. it's like fine food. it's a. it's a. it's a. it's a delicious sand castle. it's temporary, it doesn't last very long, but there's something about it that's very pleasing. yeah, yeah, um, yeah, i mean i, i don't know what, what advice to give like, um, maybe smaller, have tasty food with smaller amounts of it? yeah, and i think regulated feeding windows really the way to go, some sort of an intermittent fasting approach. sure, when i started doing that, i, i, i, i found myself to be quite a bit healthier. when i've deviated from that, i've gained weight. so how, what's, what's? uh, 16 hours? well, 16 hours, yeah, so like at night, or yeah, yeah, yeah, so i get to a certain point and then i count out. i usually, uh, hit the stopwatch on my phone and then i look at uh 15 hours and i'm like, okay, got an hour before i can eat, yeah, and so anything in between that is just water or coffee. actually, you know, like, um, this may be a useful bit of advice for for people, but, uh, eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep. yeah, um, and it can actually cause, uh it, heartburn that you don't even know is happening, and and that subtle heartburn uh affects your sleep because you're you're horizontal and your body's digesting. so, if you want to improve the quality of your sleep, um, and and um, you know, uh, you know, be healthier, uh, it's, it's- do not eat right before we go to sleep. yeah, it's like one of the worst things you could do. i had some of the biggest mistakes i've ever met. i've. i've done that, uh, particularly after comedy shows. i'm starving, i'll come home and i'll eat, and then i go to bed and i just feel like [ __ ] and i wake up in the middle of the night. it's gonna, it's gonna, crush your sleep and it's gonna, it's gonna, damage your, uh, pilot, your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus, and it's, it's, it's so, in fact, drinking and then going to sleep is that's one of the worst things you could. yes, um, so, uh, just try to avoid drinking and and you know, um, small amounts of alcohol. that evidence suggests it's not, it doesn't have a negative effect. i put in the same category as delicious food, it kind of makes things a little more fun. yeah, yeah, i like it. i mean some of the people, some of the people who have left the longest. you know, um, there's a woman in france who, i think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day, every day. you know, yeah, small, small amounts is fine, um, but, um, yeah, this is like a- i i learned this like quite late in life. it's like just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep and your quality of life will, your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot for sure. this is a. it's a big deal and i think, not widely, not widely known. do you have time to exercise, um, a little bit? um, do you train or anything? um, i do, although i haven't seen for a while, but um, yeah, especially, yeah, from out, like, uh, you know, say, we're working on starship or something in south texas and i'm just living in my i got a little little house there in bukuchika village, um, and i don't have much to do. so we're like i'm working and i was like, dude, just lift some weights or something you know. um, maybe, uh, i, i, i like i don't. some people love running. i don't love running. um, but what do you like to do? exercise, wise? um, too, totally frank, i wouldn't exercise at all if i could, but if, if i, i'd prefer not to exercise. but if i'm going to exercise and you know, lift some weights and um, and then kind of run on the treadmill and maybe watch a show that you know, if there's a compelling show that like pulls you in, right, right, right, yeah, that's a good thing to do. yeah, watch a good movie. or yeah, yeah, episode of black mirror or something like that, that's great. man, don't watch black mirror before going to bed either. well, don't watch black mirror today. it's too [ __ ] accurate. yeah, exactly, it's like: wait, this already happened in real life. yeah, they're too close. it's too close. well, even didn't. jamie, did you say that the the guy who makes black mirror mics off? uh, yeah, yeah, he said he it's not a good time to start season six. yeah, he wants to hold off because reality he's nailed, it is black mirror. oh man, it's like he's gonna have to like re reassess and and attack it from a different angle. yeah, you should try something that's fun to do, that's not just like like learn a martial art or something like that. i did martial arts when i was kid. like, did you, would you? um, i did taekwondo, i did karate, uh, kaika shrinkai, all right, cool. and um judo, um, also you, you really branched out, yeah, um, so um, and did brazilian jiu jitsu. briefly, did you, yeah, where i made in palo alto? really, yeah, oh, no [ __ ]. i was gonna suggest that that's a great thing for people like, that's a thing about jiu jitsu. if you look at it from the outside, you think, oh, a bunch of meat heads strangling each other. sure, but they're some of the smartest people i know, or jiu jitsu fiends, because they they get they. first of all, they get introduced to it because usually either they want to exercise or learn some self-defense, but then they realize that it's essentially like a language with your body, like you're having an argument with someone with some sort of a physical language, and it's really complex, and the more access to vocabulary and the sharper your words are sure, the the more you'll succeed in these ventures. that's really also an accurate analogy of what jiu jitsu is. yeah, i mean, i kind of. i mean, probably like a lot of people, uh, for the the way, uh, early day, uh, the first mma fights and joyce gracie and he was like incredible and it was like just like technique, yeah, yeah, it was like, you know, winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing. it's just like, oh, this is cool, it was what martial arts were supposed to be when we were, as we were, kids. yeah, when you saw bruce lee [ __ ] up, all these big, giant guys like, wow, martial arts allow you to beat someone far bigger and stronger than you, right, most of the time that's not real, especially if they know martial arts too. it's like, oh, no, yes, but in the ufc, when hoist gracie, off of his back, was strangling dan severin with his legs. he was like holy [ __ ]. yeah, this guy's being pinned by this big giant wrestler and he wraps his legs around his neck and chokes him to the point the guy has to surrender. yeah, amazing, yeah, it was amazing. i mean, horse got beaten up pretty bad in some of those. he did well, he definitely had some rough fights, but he won. he won. yeah, he's a legend and but what it showed in- i mean, i'm a huge lover of jiu jitsu- what it showed is that there is a method for, uh, for diffusing these situations with technique and and knowledge. yeah, and i think it's also a great way to exercise too, because it's almost like the exercise is secondary to the learning of the thing. the, the exercises like you want, like and you want to develop strength and conditioning just so that you could be better at doing the thing. and the analogy that i use is like if you imagine if you had a race car and you could actually give the race car better handling and more horsepower just from your own focus and effort. sure, that's really what it's like. yeah, totally yeah, when am i going to have my, my kids. i should say i sent my kids to uh jiu jitsu, uh, since they were like i don't know six. oh, really, yeah, oh, that's awesome, yeah, it's. it's a great thing to learn. it really is. seems like a good. yes, yeah, maybe something like i mean, even if you just have someone who hits, that holds the pads for you, like you get a workout in and to be fun, um, when am i going to be able to buy one of them, roadsters? when's that happening? well, i can't you know say exactly when, but, uh, we got to get, you know, those. this cover thing's kind of throwing us for a loop, i'm sure. um, so, um, not to blame everything in the code, but um, it's, you know, certainly set us back on on progress for, you know, some number of months, um, the, i mean things we've got to get get done. uh, ahead of roadster are, um, you know, ramping up model y production. um, that'll be a great, great car. it is a great car getting the berlin gigafactory built and and also building y, getting expanding the shanghai factory, which is going great. and um, get the. you know there's a cyber truck, semi truck, roadster. um, roaster is kind of like dessert. so, like we, we gotta get the. you know eating potatoes and greens and stuff you know like. but roaster comes before cyber truck. i mean, i think we should do cyber truck first before, before road, before started. interesting, i'm not mad at that. some other things for roadster: uh, they're, they're, you know, the tri-motor, uh, plaid powertrain. we're gonna have that in model s, uh, so that's like part one of the ingredients that's needed for for roadsters: the, the plaid powertrain, the more advanced bat, you know, battery vacuum kind of thing. i wanted to ask you about this before i forgot what. there's. a company that's called apex is taking your teslas and they're giving it a wider base and wider tires and a little bit more advanced suspension. sure, how do you feel about that? are you guys? do you work with them? are you cool with those people? yeah, i mean, just i'm off. yeah, go ahead. they're jazzing stuff up with carbon fiber and doing a bunch of interior choices you're cool with. you can't [ __ ] with that. you don't have time. so is it good that someone comes along and has a sort of specialty operation? yeah, i got no problem. that's what it's called. right, it's like jmg. is it called apex? yeah, i gotta unplug performance as apex, that's right. unplug performance, yeah, yeah, you could for sure, um, you know, lighten the car up and, uh, improve to tire traction. and have you seen that company's stuff? what they do, i don't know specifically, but there's, it's pretty dope. yeah, they make a pretty dope looking. they take model s and they, they widen it and give it a bunch of carbon fiber. that's it right there. that looks pretty nice. yeah, it does. now the, the plaid version of the model s, you are you going to widen the track and doing a bunch, do a bunch of different? i know you guys are testing at the nurburgring. can you not talk about that? well, i think we got to leave that for you know, proper sort of product unveil. i understand, yeah, i understand. um, last time you were here you convinced me to buy a tesla. i bought it and it's [ __ ] insane. oh great, glad you like it. um, i don't. it's not just pretty fun, it's like i, the way i've described it is, it makes other cars seem stupid. they just seem dumb. like i love dumb things. i love dumb cars. like i love campfires. yeah, i love campfires. i have a 1993 porsche that's air-cooled. sure, it's like re. it's not that fast. it's really slow compared to the tesla, yeah, really. so it's really quite slow, yeah, but there's something engaging about the mechanical. this is like the, the gears, and it's very, it's very analog, but it's so stupid in comparison to the tesla. like, when i want to go somewhere in the model s, i hit the gas and just goes. yeah, it just it like violates time. yeah, yeah, um, yeah, you've tried it like ludicrous plus and stuff. yeah, yeah, cool, oh, yeah, we did, just did a software update where it'll do it like a cheetah stance. so, uh, yeah, so it's it, because it's got a dynamic air suspension so it lowers the back. oh jesus, yeah, just like. uh, like a sprinter, basically, right, like, what do you do if you're a sprinter? you're going to hunker down and then, uh, so i shaved like a 10th of a second off zero six. i mean, like you know, it is pretty fun, it's. so i've taken so many people and i'm like i take them for the holy [ __ ] moment. i'm like you ready, like hang on there, and then a stomp on the gas. i've never felt anything like it. it's confusing. yeah, it really is the, the instant torque, the instant torque and just the sheer acceleration is baffling. it's baffling, it's baffling. they've never felt it. no, it's faster than falling. it's crazy, it's so fast. it's a roller coaster, yeah, and my family yells at me when i stomp the gas like um, i tell my kids i'm like you want to feel it. you want to feel it like, do it, do it, do it. my wife's like don't do it. yeah, and even if i just do it on the highway for a couple of seconds, that's pretty exciting. yeah, it's very. it's like having a roller coaster on tap. you know, it really is like a roller coaster on top, yeah, without the loopty loops, but it's the the pinning to your seat. it seems like you're not supposed to be able to experience that from some sort of a- can you know a consumer vehicle that you can- just a regular person could buy if you have the money. it seems too, too crazy. and then the idea of this roadster is a half of a second faster than that. yeah, that's madness. well, if that roads with a roadster, we're going to do some things that are kind of unfair. so we're going to take some things from like you know, from uh, kind of like rock, rocket world and put them on the car. so, oh, i read about that. explain that. like, what do you do? well, like i said, we can't. oh, the product unveiled right here, but but it's gonna do some things that aren't fair. and then the the, when we do the unveil of the roadster, let me just say that anyone who's been waiting, they won't be sorry, it's, they won't be sorry, oh, i'm sure. well, anything that goes zero to sixty, what is it? one point nine is that the zero 0-60. that's the base model. that's good. what's the top of the food chain model? okay, okay, faster than that, let's just say faster. yeah, that seems so crazy to me. now, what was it like when the dude threw the steel balls at the window and they were supposed to not break and it broke? well, yeah, i mean, i know any circumstances are. you know, you know that our demos are authentic [Laughter]. so i was not expecting that. and i, and then i think i muttered under my breath: you didn't get mad, though, no, you didn't steve jobs it um, no, i, i, i definitely swore uh, but you know, i didn't think the mic would pick it up, but it did um and uh, but so, like we practiced this, you know, behind the scenes. yeah, i would like it, tesla, we don't do. we don't do like tons of practice for for our demos, because we, we work, we're working on the cars, like we, you know, we're building new technologies and and improving the, the fundamental products, so we're not spending it like doing like hundreds of you know practice things or anything like that. we don't have time for that. um, but the, the just hours before the demo, um, both franz, uh, you know, uh is a head of design and and i were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window and it's bouncing right off, um and like, okay, this seems pretty good, seems like we got it okay, um, and then we think what happened? was that? um, when we, when, when franz hit the, the, the door with the sledgehammer, you know, sure, like, like this is this is like yeah, yeah, yeah, exoskeleton. you know high strength hardened steel, you can literally take wind up with a sledgehammer. you know full, double-handed sledgehammer, and hit the door and there's not even a dent. it's cool. but we think that that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass that you just came over. so, uh, then, when you threw the bowl, that that's what cracked the glass, so it didn't go through. though it didn't go through, that's true, that's true. it didn't shatter the whole thing like a regular window would either, which would just dissolve. yeah, right, so in hindsight, the ball should have been: first, sledgehammer, second, yeah, yeah, you live, you learn. yeah, exactly, listen man. uh, we've taken up a lot of your time. you had a child, yeah, recently. it's amazing that you had the time to come down here and i really appreciate that. i appreciate everything you do, man. i i'm i'm glad you're out there and, uh, i really appreciate you coming down here and sharing your perspective. well, i think you got a great show. thanks for having me on. thank you, my pleasure, my pleasure. elon musk. ladies and gentlemen, good night. all right, that should get a little, i should get a little play. that was great.
