seeds in the earth, fed them and watered them, more of the same plants would grow  These were some of the first farmers  And once they found a good patch of land they quite understandably didn't want to move, they soon built houses nearby and store houses to keep food through the winter  They banded together into larger communities in order to divide the labor of farming and to protect their grain should anyone else try to take it  They learned how to take the clay from the ground and shape it into pots  But they were still limited to areas where the rains were plentiful to the mountains and the foothills  From about the year 6500 BC  These human settlements began to spread century by century, millennium by millennium  They worked their way down the courses of the two great rivers and into the inhospitable land of southern Iraq  Who these people were, what language they spoke and what they called themselves, we have no idea  Today, we call this stretch of several thousand years the Ubaid period, named quite arbitrarily after the site where their first artifacts were found  As the Ubaid people moved down the rivers of Iraq, they began to notice other things, too  They noticed that date palms grew in some areas of the river, providing them with a rich and delicious source of calories  They soon found out that these, too, could be cultivated and planted in orchards  And they also noticed that these palms could provide shade for other, more fragile plants, allowing them to be grown, too, beneath the harsh Iraqi sun  And they made another crucial discovery, too  They realized that they didn't have to grow their plants only on the banks of the river  With a bit of hard work, they could dig channels that diverted the life giving water in land  Now, they could grow crops just about anywhere, so long as you could dig a canal long enough, and the people of this region would soon become very good at digging canals  Worked properly in this manner, this landscape could be immensely productive  Here, dense thickets of reeds grow so tall you can't see over the tops of them, populated with buffalo, wild boar, and marshland birds  And it's in this marshy southern landscape that the greatest Sumerian cities rose  Just as Mesopotamia was watered by two great rivers, its lands were also populated by two great peoples  These were the people of Summer and the people of Akhad  Over the course of their history, the Sumerians and the Accordion's grew together in such a symbiotic way that it's impossible to tell the story of one without the other  We know a decent amount about the Accardion people in the north  They spoke a language in the Semitic family, meaning that it's in the same language family as the Aramaic of the Bible and later Hebrew and Arabic  This language seems to have been indigenous to the region, and it shares grammar and words with many other languages that surrounded it  But the Sumerian people are much more mysterious  In fact, they are such a mystery that they have caused archaeologists to refer to what's called the Sumerian problem  Sumerians spoke what we call a language isolate  That is, it has no relation to any of the languages around it, and it's essentially in a language family all of its own  Sumerian was so alien to the region that early scholars who discovered its first texts didn't believe it could be a real language at all  They thought it must have been a kind of code used to communicate in secret  This alone has led some historians to ask whether the Sumerians may have arrived in southern Iraq from somewhere else  The Sumerian culture centered on the sea coast of Iraq's far south, and so some have suggested that they may have arrived by boat  Some backing for this theory may come in the writings of Roman historian Flavius Josephus, who wrote down a Babylonian legend that he heard in the first century Ad  It relates the story of a half man, half fish called Ohanas, who walked out of the sea and taught the people of Mesopotamia the secrets of culture  He brought them the knowledge of letters, sciences, and all kinds of techniques  He also taught them how to found cities, build temples, create laws and measure plots of land  He revealed to them how to work the land and gather fruits  After teaching mankind all these secrets, owanas leaps back into the sea and swims away  It's possible that in this myth, ancient storytellers have preserved some memory of the arrival of the Sumerians, landing en masse by boat and bringing with them their advanced urban culture  Some have even argued that the Sumerians may have come from as far afield as India  And more evidence for the migration theory seems to come from the words that the Sumerians used for their professions  For more common jobs, the ones that involved manual labor, the Sumerians used old presumearian words  Meanwhile, they brought new words with them to describe more sophisticated and urban occupations  For instance, the words for scribe and winemaker are both distinctly Sumerian  But others have proposed a more interesting theory, which does seem to solve some of these contradictions  Although it does seem a little far fetched, I think it is worth mentioning here  The clue to this theory comes once again from mythology  The Sumerian version of history was dominated by a devastating event of apocalyptic proportions  And if you were brought up reading Bible stories, you may find it familiar  The Sumerians believed that in a time long before, in the time of their most distant ancestors, a great flood had washed over the world  This same story would later pass on into the legends of the Babylonian empire and from there to the Hebrew poets who wrote the first books of the Bible  For this reason, the story of the flood is perhaps the oldest continuously told story  And it's in this legend that the clue to the origin of the Sumerians might lie  The story of the flood is so striking that many historians, with varying degrees of credibility, have tried to come up with some historical event that may have inspired it  And history is actually full of great inundations\n",

      " From carvings that depict Sumerians, we can see how they wore their hair curly on top and cut short on the sides  Common men wore sheepskin kilts, while the richer people would have worn colored fabrics spun from wool decorated with tassels and beads  Among the wealthy, both men and women wore jewelry, anklets bracelets, necklaces, and ear ornaments made of copper and sometimes gold  Remarkably, we also have a great deal of evidence about Sumerian music  Like everything else, the Sumerians wrote their music down on clay tablets  And we've also discovered other texts that explain how to play it, including how to tune the instruments  And so today we're able to hear the sounds of the music that once played in the temples and courtyards of cities like Eridu Ur and Uruk  These two great peoples, the Semitic Akardians and the Sumerians, formed a symbiosis over the next centuries that would see their cultures run in parallel  Just like their two great rivers, they shared their successes and advances  They shared the cities that were even now growing to become the largest ever seen  But they also shared their failures, and as a result, their fates became inextricably intertwined  The Sumerians believed that the world was a roughly circular landmass surrounded on all sides by a huge body of water  They believed that another ocean also lay above their heads, held in place by the solid structure of the sky, which occasionally let some of this water through as rain  They divided water into two types that of the rain and rivers sweetwater and that of the sea bitter water  Sumerians called their homeland ki engi, which means the land of the noble lords  Kor in the Sumerian language meant mountain, but it also came to mean rebellious, barbarous, and wild  To the north, the rocky Torus Mountains of Turkey and Kurdistan hemmed them in full of hardy mountain people, while the Zagros Mountains of Iran formed the edge of their world to the east  Today, the Arabic word for the region of Upper Mesopotamia still holds within it a sense of this feeling of isolation  They call it el jazziera, meaning the island  But despite the challenges of their landscape, the Sumerians flourished  They had no stone to build with, so instead they learned to make bricks from the river mud, mixing them with straw, gravel and broken pottery and baking them with clay  They made everything from pots and plates to sickles and writing tablets  They had no wood, so instead they harvested vast numbers of reeds, tying them together into bundles and platting them together into mats  The Sumerians invented or adopted the pottery wheel, the wagon wheel, the plow and the sailboat  Their buildings used complex arches and domes  They worked out how to cast metals such as copper and later, bronze  And the Sumerians were also avid mathematicians  They developed complex systems of measurement, as well as methods for dividing, multiplying and calculating angles, even writing down the first ever multiplication tables on clay tablets  We actually use Sumerian mathematics every day\n",

      " The 360 degrees we still use in angle measurement is another relic of this system  Due to this spark of ingenuity, sumerian society grew at a slow but steady pace  They dug vast networks of irrigation canals that extended the agricultural zone around the rivers and also allowed them to transport goods in canal boats  They built dams to regulate the flow of the rivers and ensure that the spring floods came in a more controlled way  In fact, the Sumerian language has a vast array of words to describe the different kinds of canals, reservoirs, dams, and lock gates required to control their water  Gradually, the landscape of southern Iraq transformed from dusty salt flats and marshy swamps to a green patchwork of farmland  Many historians have argued that it was the digging of these canals and water courses that originally led to the greater social organization we see during the Sumerian period  These extensive systems of water management needed careful planning, engineering expertise, and mathematical calculations  Work teams needed to be organized and paid in food and beer  Foreman and overseers needed to be appointed  And all of this led to a kind of early bureaucracy that gave rise to the first true states  In the 1930s, historian Arnold Toynbee famously argued that it was just these environmental challenges in southern Iraq that created the conditions in which civilization could be created\n",

      " Since there was no currency at this time, workers were paid directly in food and other goods  The minimum ration of an unskilled factory worker consisted of 20 liters of bali a month, along with two liters of oil and two kilos of wool per year  Meanwhile, their supervisor would earn roughly twice this ration  The poor in Sumerian society were downtrodden and were probably pretty miserable  They often had to borrow food or silver from predatory money lenders at crushing interest rates of as high as 30%  But despite this rising inequality, by the middle of the fourth millennium BC  Economic advancement meant that the city of Uruk had grown into the largest and most powerful city in southern Mesopotamia  This was around the year 3500 BC  Or over 5000 years ago  By this time, nearly 2000 years had already passed since the original founding of the first city at Eridu  That's enough time to take us from the present moment to the age of Julius Caesar  By this time, Sumerian civilization was already ancient  But the very earliest of the pyramids of Egypt would still not be built for another 900 years  In Britain, the Neolithic monument Stonehenge was at this time just a series of barrows and earthworks, and its large stones would not be moved into place for another 1300 years  By this time, Uruk would have had about 500 inhabitants  That's only enough to fill a modern mediumsized football stadium  But at this time, it was the largest city that the Earth had ever seen  The world's earliest surviving piece of literature, known as the Epoch of Gilgamesh, begins in this city  It is the story of a king of Uruk named Gilgamesh who likely ruled some time in the third millennium  Whatever the historical facts of his reign are, gilgamesh made enough of an impression as a ruler that he went down into legend as a mythical hero, twothirds god and onethird man  And although there's much more myth than fact in this ancient tale, the Gilgamesh epoch does tell us a little about how Sumerian society changed in the early centuries of the third millennium  For one thing, it's clear that warfare had begun to increase in the region  The tale opens in the powerful city of Uruk, and one feature of the city is mentioned as a great source of pride  That's a ring of enormous fortified walls  As these lines from the epic of Gilgamesh show  Behold the outer walls which gleam like copper  See the inner wall, which none can rival, touch the threshold\n",

      " May NA Daba, the personal goddess of Lugal Zaghi, make him bear all these sins  After sacking Lagashe, Lugel Zagazi's momentum seems to have been unstoppable  He worked his way north up the course of the two rivers, and soon he had conquered all the regions that Lagasse had once claimed  32 kings gathered against him, but he defeated them and smote their cities and prostrated their lords, and destroyed the whole countryside as far as the silver mines  Admittedly, this is probably something of an exaggeration  The Sumerians had never been able to maintain distant colonies or occupy far off lands for very long  It's more likely that Lugal Zagazi pulled off something like a successful raiding party on the coast, perhaps looting some towns and cities and bringing treasure back to Uruk  But this was the first time that a Sumerian prince had ever made this claim  But King Lugal Zagazi, like the rulers of Lagashe before him, had made the critical mistake of overstretching his resources  This empire was simply too big  Before long, civil wars and rebellions broke out between the various Sumerian cities  In this time of chaos, the other great people of Mesopotamia began to fancy their chances at ruling  These were the people who, up until this moment, had been something of a junior partner in the civilization of southern Iraq  These were the people of aquad  One man would soon lead them in an outright rebellion against the Sumerian Empire  He would go down in history with a name that inner cardian means the one true king  That name was Sargon, and he ushered in the twilight of the Sumerian age  Like many episodes in Sumerian history, the origin story of Sagon Avocad is one you might find familiar if you were brought up on the stories of the Bible  He was born sometime in the middle of the 24th century BC\n",

      " Sagon founded a new city to act as his empire's capital, and he named it Akad  From there, he would go on to conquer much of what the preceding empires had before  As one inscription beneath a statue in the city of Nepur claims, sargon, the King of Kish, triumphed in 34 battles over the cities up to the edge of the sea and destroyed their walls  He bowed down to the gods and the gods gave him the upper land up to the cedar forest and up to the silver Mountain  And Sargon didn't make the mistakes of his predecessors  At each city he conquered, he made a point of destroying the city's walls, reducing its ability to defend itself, and therefore reducing the likelihood of it rebelling against his rule  He conducted a ceremony to symbolize his mastery over the whole land  He washed his weapons in the waters of both the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea  But once the dust of war had settled, his achievements went on  He made efforts to centralize the empire's administration and even reformed the dating system  His reforms strengthened the central state and increased the stability of the empire  In many ways, he was something of a progressive and enlightened ruler  But Sargon was also a cardian, and he was what we today might call a nationalist  Until now, Sumerian had been the official language of royal inscriptions on palaces and temples  But during Sargon's reign, akardian began to be used in official inscriptions for the first time  The Cuneiform alphabet was now reengineered to write a cardian  And Sargon also gave himself the new title king of Arcade  He appointed only his fellow acadians to key positions in the government and garrisoned Sumerian cities with accordion troops to ensure their loyalty  The two people of Mesopotamia who had lived and grown together for millennia were now beginning to drift apart  Resentment in the southern Sumerianspeaking cities began to reach a boiling point  Sargon ruled for 55 years, and towards the end of his reign, this resentment bubbled over  As one later Babylonian text recalls, in his old age, all the lands revolted against him and they besieged him in a cob the city  But he went forth to battle and defeated them  He knocked them over and destroyed their vast army for the meantime  It's clear that Sargon's flair for battle kept his empire together  But as the old king weakened, virtually all the southern cities burst out in open rebellion  When Sargon avakad died around the year 22 84, his two sons had to take over and try to fix the mess he had left behind  The first of these sons was called Ramush  He ruled for nine years and spent most of them in bitter battles to reconquer the rebellious Sumerian cities of the south  He crushed rebellions in Ur  Ummah Lagash and ADAP And one of the years in which he ruled is even known as the year that Adab was destroyed  When Rimu died, Sargon's other son, Manish Tuxu, took over  He seems to have resorted to the kinds of terror tactics that had once made the kings of Lagash so hated  It was Sagon's grandson, a man named Naramsin, who had returned the empire to its former greatness  He managed to quell the Sumerian rebellion in its southern heartlands and returned the empire of Akad to stability  And Naram Sin didn't rule only by force, it seems  But this didn't entirely heal the rift  There was even now continuing to grow between these two peoples  Part of the problem was that the Sumerian people were no longer the primary cultural force in the region  For centuries, Akardian had been gradually replacing Sumerian as a spoken language  Some of this may have been down to the official policies of the AKADIAN Empire, discouraging the use of Sumerian in official documents  But it was also affected by the increasingly cosmopolitan makeup of the empire  Sumerian, as we've seen, was a language isolate with a different structure and sound to all the languages around it  But the people who lived in all the surrounding lands spoke languages that were linguistic cousins of a Cardion, all in the Semitic family of languages  They had the same grammar and even shared sounds and words with a cardian  Learning a Cardion for them would have been like an English speaker learning French or Spanish, while Sumerian would have been like learning Korean  Acadian was just easier to learn for these people, and so it would naturally become the language of trade and commerce  Slowly, the Sumerian language began to fade  But the days of the Akardian empire were also numbered, and the Sumerians would get one more chance to leave their mark on the world's history  When the great Acadian King Naramsin died, his son Shah Kali Shari took over  He was Sagon of Akad's great grandson, and four years into his reign, a great celestial sign would have appeared in the skies overhead\n",

Who was not the king?  Four of them ruled in only three years  All this chaos did not go unnoticed  In the mountains overlooking the plains of Mesopotamia, a nomadic tribal people known as the Guti were watching  Who the Guti were, what language they spoke, and which gods they worshiped, we don't know  They seem to have been an unsophisticated nomadic people, and the ancient Sumerian texts reserve particular contempt for them  The Gutt were unhappy people, unaware of how to revere the gods, and ignorant of the right religious practices\n",

      " For reasons known only to them and perhaps relating to their nomadic lifestyle, they didn't believe in keeping animals in pens  They released all of the land's livestock to roam about the countryside freely  Their policies soon brought even further famine and caused a massive increase in the price of grain  Under neglect and lack of investment, the land's infrastructure began to crumble  The poetry of The Curse of Akad shows how the roads of the kingdom began to fall apart and become overgrown with weeds  While long grass grew on the tow paths where oxen used to pull barges, the grass grows long on your canal bank tow paths  The grass of mourning grows on your highways laid for wagons, wild rams and snakes of the mountains allow no one to pass on your topas built up with canal sediment  The destruction of the central authority of the AKADIAN empire meant that during this time, a number of Sumerian city states reasserted their independence  And it seems the Guti, weakened by their failing attempt to hold an empire together, don't seem to have been able to do much to stop them  The Guti occupied southern Iraq for more than 150 years, and this period was, by all accounts, a time of suffering  It was a miniature dark age where written records are unsophisticated as well as few and far between  But as resentment to their rule grew, rebellions rose around the country  And one Sumerian man would see the opportunity this period of crisis provided  He was filled with a desire to return the lands of Summer to the rule of a Sumerian king and his name was Utu Hengal  Little is known about the life of Utu Hengal  He was a Sumerian and may have been the governor of Uruk during the final years of the Gutian period  He must have watched as the ongoing famine ravaged his people and the arrogant Gooty kings refused to do anything about it, violently punishing any resistance to them  At this time, a new Gucci king had just ascended to the throne of Suma and Akad  His name was Tyrigan, and he seems to have been typical of the Guti rulers  He cared little for maintaining the land's infrastructure and even destroyed elements of it to punish populations who rebelled against him  As recalled in the Sumerian king List, tiragan's troops established themselves everywhere  Nobody would leave their cities to face him in the south  In Suma, he blocked the water from the fields  In the uplands, he closed off the roads  Because of him, the grass grew high on the highways of the land\n",

      " Meanwhile, the rebel leader Utuhengal massed his forces and marched to meet the two Guti generals on the field  On his way to the decisive battle, he stopped at the temple of Ishkur, the Sumerian god of storms, and made an offering  He may have sacrificed a lamb or goat and sang an ancient prayer in the Sumerian tongue before the altar of the god  Then he marched out to meet Tiragan's armies  After departing from the temple of Ishkur on the fourth day, he set up camp in Nagsu on the sura Gal Canal  He captured the generals of Tirigan, sent as envoys to Suma and put chains on their hands  Utuhengal was victorious  And here again we see that the Guti king, Tyragan wasn't the courageous sort  After getting the news that his generals had been defeated, he fled north to a city called D'broom  The Sumerian king list records what happened next  Then Tyragan, the king of the Gucci, ran away alone on foot  He thought himself safe in Dubram, where he fled to save his life  But since the people of Dubam knew that Utu Hengal was a king endowed with power by en Lil  They did not let Tyragan go, and an envoy of Utuhengal arrested Tiragan  Together with his wife and children in Dubrom  He put handcuffs and a blindfold on him  After centuries, the Sumerians finally rejected both Guti and Akardian rule  For the first time since the reign of Sagon, a Sumerian king would once again rule over the lands of Suma  Utu Hengal made the Guti, the Fang snakes of the Mountains, go back to drink again from the rocky crevices  He brought back the kingship of summer  Utu Hengal's successful rebellion ushered in an era known today as the Third Dynasty of Ul and sometimes called the Neosumarian Empire  Others have even called this the Sumerian Renaissance  It was the final flourishing of Sumerian culture, but it was a flourishing that would leave an indelible mark on human history\n",

      " Towering over all the other lowlying buildings in the city, it was built purely from baked clay bricks and held together with the tari substance bitumen  It's thought that it would have taken at least 1500 workers more than five years just to build its base  Farmers up to 20 km away would have been able to see the synonymous shape rising on the horizon  To them, it would have testified to the power of the city of Ur and the god who lived there  But despite this late flourishing, the age of the Sumerians was passing  And part of the reason for this lay in the soil beneath their feet  All river water contains small amounts of salts and other minerals  And the Tigris and Euphrates rivers flowing over the limestone rocks of the Torus Mountains contain more than most  When ancient farmers diverted this water into their fields to feed their crops, the hot sun would evaporate this water and traces of salt would be left behind  In places with a reasonable amount of rainfall, the rain would wash this salt away  But in the arid conditions of Iraq, the salt stays right where it is  Over time, this small amount builds up on the surface of the soil and eventually plants find it difficult to grow  The records of the Sumerian scribes paint a bleak picture  They kept meticulous notes of crop yields year on year and from around 2350 BC  Their texts show the gradual reduction of crops across the region  One telltale detail shows us that the salt content of the soil might have been to blame  While their main crop of wheat gradually reduced over the centuries, the rates of barley production remained constant  Barley, as we know today, is particularly resistant to salt rich soil  Texts uncovered from the city of Girzu show that around the year 3550 BC, wheat and barley were being produced in equal amounts  But after 1000 years of irrigation, wheat accounted for only one 6th of the crop  And only a few centuries later, in the 21st century BC, wheat was less than 2% of the annual harvest  This all points to a sharp increase in the salt content of the soil  You can sometimes hear very simplistic narratives surrounding soil's salonation in the south of Iraq  The Sumerians are sometimes portrayed as stupid or greedy, damaging the land in their ignorance  But that's not entirely fair  Although they didn't have our modern understanding, they did know that soil needed to be rested for several seasons if it was to remain fertile  And they did take steps to adapt to the changing condition of the soil, switching almost exclusively to barley and replacing the role of wheat in their diet  They also developed methods for draining the soil and reducing the rate of salination  But soil salinity is a challenge that still causes problems for farmers in Iraq today, despite all our technology and scientific knowledge  While the ancient people worked hard to mitigate the decline, the overall trend as the centuries wore on was slow but unstoppable  The soil was gradually failing, and with the population of Sumerian cities growing and the long drought dragging on, the demands on this farmland were only increasing  Eventually, a thick layer of salt would encrust the topsoil and little would grow at all  Today, when you walk around the deserts of Iraq, the soil in some areas has a crumbly crust that cracks underfoot, peeling like old varnish  This is the salt that slowly began to choke the life from the earth and in turn, choke the life from the civilization of Suma  But the end of Sumerian culture would come not from the soil, but at the tip of a spear  As the Sumerians struggled to eat ever decreasing barley crops from the salty soil, it seems that once again, hostile outside forces began to sense weakness in this once great empire  After their failed attempt at empire building, the nomadic Guti had retreated to their mountains and returned to their nomadic ways  But they still posed a threat to Sumerian lands, just as they always had, raiding towns and making away with cattle  Putting a stop to these raids was the focus of much of the king Urnamu's reign  He raised an army and marched into the Gutie lands with the aim of putting a stop to the threat forever  It's unclear whether he actually met them in battle or whether he was struck by one of their characteristic ambushes  Either way, unnamu was killed in the mountains far from home  The death of this king, which would begin the final death spiral of Sumerian culture, was commemorated in a lengthy epic poem known as The Death of Ornamu  He who was beloved by the troops could not raise his neck anymore  The wise one lay down  Silence descended as he who was the vigor of the land had fallen  The land became demolished like a mountain, like a cypress forest, it was stripped  Its appearance changed  The poem tells the story of Urinamu descending into the underworld and giving his offerings to the gods who lived there and in the afterlife  The poem gives Urnamu himself this final lament now, just as the rain pouring down from heaven cannot turn back, I can never return to see the beautiful bricks of Ur  Four Sumerian kings would follow Urunamu  Some, like the king Shulgi, enjoyed successes on the battlefield and developed and reformed the economy as much as they could  But their reigns were characterized by ongoing threats from the wild mountain regions  The drought was still biting the soil was becoming increasingly choked by salt, and as food got scarce, more and more nomadic people were driven to raiding and plundering to feed themselves  By now, the Guti were far from the only people who threatened the border of Sumar and Akhad  One tribe in particular, known as the Matu, posed a particular threat  The Matu were a Semitic sheep herding, people from the mountains of Syria and Lebanon  Like the Guti, the Sumerians considered them to be wild and barbarous and tended to describe them in contemptuous but also fearful terms  The Marti, the powerful south wind who from the remote past have not known cities  The Martu, who know no grain  The Martu, who know no house or town  The savages of the mountains  The Martu, who eat raw meats, who are not buried after their deaths  Another text describes them in similar animalistic terms as the Guti  The hostile Martu have entered the plains  The Martu are ravaging people with canine instincts like wolves  And it's clear that around this time of drought and famine, the Motu were finding their way of life in Syria  Increasingly impossible environmental pressures were pushing them further south into the rich farmland of the river valley, into the lands of the Sumerians  Despite the weakened power of the Sumerian state, the later kings of summer were determined to stop the Martu incursions  One king, named Xu Xin, even ordered the construction of a wall that stretched almost 300 km between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers  It would be called the Martu Wall and sometimes the wall facing the highlands  What form exactly this wall took is unknown, since its remains have never been found  But it was likely an earthwork rampart dotted with forts and perhaps fronted with a moat fed by canals  It would have been an enormous engineering work and shows that even in its final years, the Sumerian state still commanded considerable manpower and energy  But ultimately, the wall would prove useless  Like all walls, it was only effective with a constant garrison manning it  Soon it would become clear that the building of this wall was not an act of strength, but the last resort of an empire falling in on itself  The last Sumerian king was a man named IBI Sin, who took the throne in the year 2028  Virtually as soon as he was crowned, the empire began to fall apart  In his first year of ruling, the eastern city of Ashuna broke free from the empire  And Sousa, a city in the region of Elam in the Iranian lowlands, successfully rebelled in the third year  These Elamites were an ambitious people  They were rivals for the later Assyrian and Babylonian empires, but at this stage were only just beginning to flex  Their muscles, their eyes would spell the end of the Sumerian age  The fracturing Sumerian empire could no longer maintain its defenses along the 300 great Martin Wall  And so, in the fifth year of his reign, the wall that Ibisin's father had built failed  The matu poured over the defenses and overran the rich farmlands that lay behind  The effects of this loss were immediate and devastating  Food shortages ran rampant  In years seven and eight of Ibiza's kingship, the price of grain increased to 60 times the usual cost  People would have starved in the streets  The famine was hitting the capital city of Ur especially hard, and it's clear that at this point, the king Ibisin really began to panic  Desperate to feed his people, king Ibisin summoned one of his generals and told him to travel north to the city of his in to buy grain and pay many times its usual cost  This general was a man called Ishpie Era, and it's clear that he wasn't the most trusted of the king's generals  In another letter, the king had even complained that Ishby Era was Akardian, not Sumerian, inferring that his loyalty may have been in question  But at this point, it's clear the king didn't have much choice  One remarkable letter from this moment has survived  It was sent to the king Ibisin by this general, Ishbi Era  Once he reached the city of Izan\n",

      " The fall of Ur was one of the great turning points in ancient history  It marked the end of the unified Sumerian state  And the region entered a small, dark age in which individual citystates once again vied for control over the ruins of the former empire  The wars of this period turned Sumerian cities to blackened heaps of burnt brick  The people mourn it's  People like broken potshots'littering  The approaches, the walls were gaping  The high gates, the roads were piled with dead  In all the streets and roadways bodies lay in open fields that used to fill the dances  The people lay in heaps and meanwhile the drought dragged on and the saltridden fields were no longer producing enough bali  Faced with these problems, the Sumerian people began to flock out of the region in huge numbers  Refugees carrying with them their meager belongings and weeping for the home they had left behind  Over the next centuries, a vast population movement took place from the south of Mesopotamia to the north  Some of these Sumerian speakers would settle in the accadian lands  But with their connection to their homelands severed, their cultural identity went with it  They learned the accardion language of the northerners and left theirs behind in the smoking ruins of their cities  The Martu, those wild hill people so detested by the Sumerians would themselves settle down in the cities they conquered along the river valley  The migrating matu, the fleeing Sumerians and the native accordions would mix together  They would blend their cultures, as the people of this region always had  The foundations they laid would give rise to the next chapter of Mesopotamian and human history and forge the region's next superpowers  These would rise as the legendary empires of Babylon and Assyria  But those are stories that I will save for another time  Sumerian was now a dead language  It would never again be heard spoken in the streets and the markets  For these later people, Sumerian became the language of the gods, the language of myth and magic  The kings of Ur, those great Sumerian rulers themselves, passed into legend, and some of them would later be revered as gods themselves  King of Ur, king of Summer and Acad  Even after the fall of the Sumerian Empire, many of its great cities would continue as population centers into the postsummerian era  Among these was the great coastal city of Ur, situated at the mouth of the Euphrates, which would rise and fall a number of times over its history  But ultimately, it was the landscape that had given birth to UV, and it was the landscape that would bring about its demise  Today, if you stand in the ruins of Ur, the sea that once lapped its shores is nowhere to be seen  In fact, early archeologists were astonished to see the remains of millions of seashells scattered in the sand here on this lonely stretch of desert  As the millennia passed, the continued depositing of silt, along with changes in global sea levels, have combined to push Iraq's Gulf Coast back to its present position  About 150 Euphrates River that once brought the rich bounties of trade down from the north has also disappeared, its course having changed over the centuries  In fact, around the barren mounds of earth where the city of Ur once stood, there's nothing at all but the lone and level sands of the Iraqi desert  Boundless and bare for miles around  Water had always been this city's lifeblood and the loss of the river and the sea meant the slow death of Ur  People soon left its houses and its streets  They stopped working its fields and maintaining its irrigation canals  And soon the land dried up and the topsoil blew away in the wind  The priests extinguished the fires that burned in the top chamber of URA's great cigarette and stopped leaving their offerings there to the moon god's Sin  The markets closed and the mud brick buildings of the city began to crumble  The wooden beams of the roofs rotted and fell in the sands and desert winds rolled through its streets and the dunes buried its fallen walls  Somewhere buried in the ruins lay the clay tablets on which the lament for the city's destruction was written  May that storm swoop down no more on your city  May the door be closed on it like the great city gate at nighttime until distant days, other days, future days in your city reduced to ruin mounds  May a lament be made to you, O Nanna  May you restored city be resplendent before you  Following the sacking of Ur  Around the year 2000 BC, the city of Uruk went into a steep decline and much of its population fled  Uruk did have another period of flourishing when the later Assyrian Empire rebuilt it as a regional capital  But as the Euphrates River changed its course, uruk, too, would be completely abandoned  Today, the walls of Uruk, the same walls that are boasted about in the epoch of Gilgamesh, are still visible heaps of ancient brickwork lining the flat lunar landscape of the desert  But they are still 15 meters tall, encircling the whole city, now washed by a tide of broken pottery and bones  The English archeologist William Loftus was the first European to rediscover the ruins of Uruk  He was impressed with the haunting sight of the vast mounds rising out of the desert and he later wrote about how the sight affected him  Of all the desolate sights I ever beheld, that of Uruk incomparably surpasses all the process of decay  In all the cities of ancient Suma in Nepur, Eridu, Lagashe, Ur and rUK would have been gradual but unstoppable  Windborne, sand and earth would pile up against the walls that still stood and filled in the streets  Meanwhile, rainwater and wind wore down any remaining structures  The sight of these ruins amazed travelers who, like the Italian Dela Valley, passed by them and saw their lonely shapes on the horizon  People told stories about what must have happened to those people who built such enormous constructions and then disappeared forever  Echoes of these stories still survive in tales like the Tower of Babel about a people who built a tower that would reach to the heavens and who were struck down by God on account of their pride  With their cities lost, the Sumerian people passed out of history  The civilizations who replaced them, who kept their language alive in their temples and still told stories of their kings, would themselves pass into ruin  The knowledge of how to read Sumerian was forgotten entirely and its history turned to dust  Only their clay tablets remained buried in the sands of Iraq fragments containing the voices of a whole people waiting for archeologists to discover them  And through arduous and painstaking work to find out how to read them\n",

       " ' It was June 18, 1625 when they spotted a distant group of tribesmen on the horizon',\n",
       " ' Their guides decided that they might be in danger and began to search for a place to hide',\n",
       " ' In the distance, they spotted the looming mass of a series of enormous ruins',\n",
       " ' Our removal hence being still deferred, I went in the forenoon to take a more diligent view of the ruins of the above said ancient building',\n",
       " ' What it had been, I could not understand, but I had found it to have been built with very good bricks, most of which were stamped with certain unknown letters which appeared very ancient',\n",
       " ' I observed that they had been cemented together not with lime, but with bitumen or pitch',\n",
       " ' De la Valley was fascinated by the broken fragments of writing that littered the ground of this ruined place',\n",
       " ' He explored further and wrote down some of the symbols that he saw again and again, stamped into the stones and pieces of clay brick',\n",
       " ' Surveying the ruins again, I found on the ground some pieces of black marble, hard and fine, engraving them with the same letters as the bricks, which seemed to me to be a kind of seal',\n",

       " ' Two I found in many places',\n",
       " ' One was like a pyramid and the other resembled a star of eight points',\n",

       " \" Eventually, negotiations with the local leader fell apart and Dela Valet's guides no longer felt safe\",\n",

       " ' For nearly 2000 vast floodplain of these rivers is today the land we call Iraq',\n",
       " ' In Arabic, this area is called Biled el Rafidin, the land of the two rivers',\n",
       " ' And in the west it has been known since ancient times by its Greek name combining the words mesos, or middle and potatoes or River Mesopotamia, the land between the rivers',\n",
       " ' These two great waterways are known as the Tigris and the Euphrates',\n",
       " ' For millennia, these rivers have brought life down into the flat flood plain of Iraq',\n",
       " ' And the source of that life comes from some of the most lifeless things the rocks of the mountains themselves',\n",
       " ' Virtually all rocks are held together with tiny flecks of two different materials called quartz and felt bar',\n",
       " ' Quartz is a clear glittering crystal formed from oxygen and silicon, while felt spa is a complex mineral derived from silicon',\n",
       " \" Together they make up over 60% of the earth's crust\",\n",
       " ' And when rivers cut their roots through the mountain gullies and underground streams, their waters wash over the rocks and dissolve their soluble parts',\n",
       " \" But quartz and Phelps bar don't dissolve in water, and so these tiny crystals are carried along by the river in a cloud of glittering particles\",\n",
       " ' We call this substance silt',\n",
       " ' Silt is sometimes known by the more poetic name rock flower, and its particles are smaller than a grain of sand',\n",
       " ' But these tiny specks can have an enormous impact',\n",
       " ' Soil with a high silt content tends to hold water better and promotes air circulation',\n",
       " ' And for this reason, silty soil forms the perfect habitat for most plants',\n",
       " ' The rivers Tigris and Euphrates transport vast amounts of silt down into the lowlands of Iraq every year',\n",
       " ' And as a consequence, this flat stretch of otherwise arid desert has become exceptionally fertile',\n",
       " ' For the history of this region and the history of all humanity, these tiny particles would prove immensely significant',\n",
       " ' Other than its rich clay soil, the desert plains of southern Iraq are an inhospitable landscape',\n",
       " ' In fact, this is perhaps the last place you might expect the first human civilizations to arise',\n",
       " ' For one thing, the climate of this region is extremely hot and dry',\n",
       " ' Summer temperatures can reach over 52 degrees centigrade, or 126 degrees Fahrenheit, and rainfall is rare, especially in summer',\n",
       " ' Coupled with the strong winds that blow across these plains, this means that the soil is arid and windswept',\n",
       " ' And although the seasonal flooding of the rivers brings life to the earth',\n",
       " ' These floods are also unpredictable',\n",
       " ' In Egypt, the river Nile flows directly from the Great Lakes of Africa, which act as a stabilizing and regulating force',\n",
       " ' But the Tigris and Euphrates depend on the amount of rain that fell on the mountains of Turkey, Armenia and Kurdistan a quantity that varies greatly from year to year',\n",
       " ' Years of drought can often be followed by years of devastating floods',\n",
       " ' And during winter, the whole plain is covered with a thick layer of mud',\n",
       " ' The region of southern Iraq is also poor in natural resources',\n",
       " ' The land is essentially nothing but a floodplain made of clay and silt',\n",
       " ' There are no metals to be mined here and virtually no stone',\n",

       " ' But about 130 years ago, things began to change',\n",
       " ' The first nomadic huntergatherers began to settle down in permanent villages',\n",
       " ' These early innovators had noticed something interesting',\n",
       " ' They saw that when they threw away the discarded seeds of edible plants, that same plant would later sprout out of their rubbish dumps',\n",
       " ' And this gave them an idea',\n",
       " ' They realized that if you buried plant seeds in the earth, fed them and watered them, more of the same plants would grow',\n",
       " ' These were some of the first farmers',\n",
       " \" And once they found a good patch of land they quite understandably didn't want to move, they soon built houses nearby and store houses to keep food through the winter\",\n",
       " ' They banded together into larger communities in order to divide the labor of farming and to protect their grain should anyone else try to take it',\n",
       " ' They learned how to take the clay from the ground and shape it into pots',\n",
       " ' But they were still limited to areas where the rains were plentiful to the mountains and the foothills',\n",
       " ' From about the year 6500 BC',\n",
       " ' These human settlements began to spread century by century, millennium by millennium',\n",

       " ' Today, we call this stretch of several thousand years the Ubaid period, named quite arbitrarily after the site where their first artifacts were found',\n",
       " ' As the Ubaid people moved down the rivers of Iraq, they began to notice other things, too',\n",
       " ' They noticed that date palms grew in some areas of the river, providing them with a rich and delicious source of calories',\n",
       " ' They soon found out that these, too, could be cultivated and planted in orchards',\n",
       " ' And they also noticed that these palms could provide shade for other, more fragile plants, allowing them to be grown, too, beneath the harsh Iraqi sun',\n",
       " ' And they made another crucial discovery, too',\n",
       " \" They realized that they didn't have to grow their plants only on the banks of the river\",\n",
       " ' With a bit of hard work, they could dig channels that diverted the life giving water in land',\n",
       " ' Now, they could grow crops just about anywhere, so long as you could dig a canal long enough, and the people of this region would soon become very good at digging canals',\n",

       " \" They spoke a language in the Semitic family, meaning that it's in the same language family as the Aramaic of the Bible and later Hebrew and Arabic\",\n",

       " ' Sumerians spoke what we call a language isolate',\n",
       " \" That is, it has no relation to any of the languages around it, and it's essentially in a language family all of its own\",\n",
       " \" Sumerian was so alien to the region that early scholars who discovered its first texts didn't believe it could be a real language at all\",\n",
       " ' They thought it must have been a kind of code used to communicate in secret',\n",
       " ' This alone has led some historians to ask whether the Sumerians may have arrived in southern Iraq from somewhere else',\n",
       " \" The Sumerian culture centered on the sea coast of Iraq's far south, and so some have suggested that they may have arrived by boat\",\n",
       " ' Some backing for this theory may come in the writings of Roman historian Flavius Josephus, who wrote down a Babylonian legend that he heard in the first century Ad',\n",
       " ' It relates the story of a half man, half fish called Ohanas, who walked out of the sea and taught the people of Mesopotamia the secrets of culture',\n",
       " ' He brought them the knowledge of letters, sciences, and all kinds of techniques',\n",
       " ' He also taught them how to found cities, build temples, create laws and measure plots of land',\n",

       " ' After teaching mankind all these secrets, owanas leaps back into the sea and swims away',\n",
       " \" It's possible that in this myth, ancient storytellers have preserved some memory of the arrival of the Sumerians, landing en masse by boat and bringing with them their advanced urban culture\",\n",
       " ' Some have even argued that the Sumerians may have come from as far afield as India',\n",
       " ' And more evidence for the migration theory seems to come from the words that the Sumerians used for their professions',\n",
       " ' For more common jobs, the ones that involved manual labor, the Sumerians used old presumearian words',\n",
       " ' Meanwhile, they brought new words with them to describe more sophisticated and urban occupations',\n",
       " ' For instance, the words for scribe and winemaker are both distinctly Sumerian',\n",
       " ' But others have proposed a more interesting theory, which does seem to solve some of these contradictions',\n",
       " ' Although it does seem a little far fetched, I think it is worth mentioning here',\n",
       " ' The clue to this theory comes once again from mythology',\n",
       " ' The Sumerian version of history was dominated by a devastating event of apocalyptic proportions',\n",
       " ' And if you were brought up reading Bible stories, you may find it familiar',\n",
       " ' The Sumerians believed that in a time long before, in the time of their most distant ancestors, a great flood had washed over the world',\n",
       " ' This same story would later pass on into the legends of the Babylonian empire and from there to the Hebrew poets who wrote the first books of the Bible',\n",

       " ' And history is actually full of great inundations',\n",
       " ' When the last ice Age ended around 10,000 BC, global temperatures rose between four to seven degrees over a period of about 5000 years',\n",
       " ' Up until that point, vast ice sheets had covered the land in the north of the planet, reaching as far south as Berlin',\n",
       " ' But as temperatures rose, these ice caps melted and their water poured back into the oceans',\n",
       " ' Global sea levels rose an average of two and a half centimeters a year, until by the end, the sea had risen an incredible 120 meters, or enough to completely swallow a 30 story building',\n",

       " ' Today, some historians have argued that Neolithic humans may have made their home in this fertile valley, having journeyed down from the mountains of Iran',\n",
       " ' But as the glaciers melted, the sea advanced, slowly at first, but with an increasing speed',\n",
       " ' Over the next 5000 years, the coastline would have moved an average rate of 120 meters a year',\n",
